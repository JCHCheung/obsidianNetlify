“Perioperative [[anaemia\|anaemia]] is an independent risk factor for increased length of hospital and intensive care stay, postoperative complications, and increased mortality” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TSX4E2H9?page=28&annotation=CWKU8VYN) ([Thakrar et al., 2017, p. 28](zotero://select/library/items/DXHK2PDX))

“PBM focuses upon three pillars of care (Table 2): 
1. The optimization of red cell mass and erythropoiesis ==before operation==. 
2. The minimization of blood loss. 
3. The management of ==postoperative== [[anaemia\|anaemia]].” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TSX4E2H9?page=28&annotation=C6MDQGYB) ([Thakrar et al., 2017, p. 28](zotero://select/library/items/DXHK2PDX))

“The recent NICE guidance however, concluded that the benefit from a reduction in the numbers of patients transfused was offset by a potential increase in mortality and thrombotic complications. NICE recommended that [[EPO\|EPO]] ==should not be used== in surgical patients to reduce blood transfusion. Therefore a haematologist must be involved in any decision to use EPO for severe preoperative anaemia” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TSX4E2H9?page=31&annotation=I2KIJQT5) ([Thakrar et al., 2017, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/DXHK2PDX))

“Intraoperative management of blood loss may be influenced by ==surgical== technique, ==anaesthetic== blood loss reduction strategies, and ==pharmacological== management. Surgical technique is the key factor in determining perioperative blood loss. ==Minimally invasive== surgery such as laparoscopic, robot assisted, and endovascular techniques are associated with a reduction in blood loss when compared with open more invasive approaches. Meticulous haemostasis is vital in preventing perioperative bleeding. The use of intraoperative topical haemostatic agents, containing collagens, fibrin or thrombin, may assist in the control of local bleeding.

The use of [[Knowledge/Medicine/Regional Anaesthesia\|regional anaesthesia]] is an anaesthetic blood sparing strategy. Central [Neuraxial block](../../Knowledge/Medicine/Neuraxial%20block.md) has been shown to significantly reduce perioperative blood loss. Orthopaedic surgery remains the surgical speciality in which there is the most robust evidence for minimization of perioperative blood loss with the use of [neuraxial blockade](../../Knowledge/Medicine/Neuraxial%20block.md), and [[Knowledge/Medicine/Regional Anaesthesia\|regional anaesthesia]] should be considered for all major joint surgery. Maintenance of a balanced physiology to aid optimal coagulation is essential: avoiding [[hypothermia\|hypothermia]], [[acidosis\|acidosis]], and [[hypocalcaemia\|hypocalcaemia]]. Maintaining core body temperature above 35C, pH > 7.2 and ionized calcium > 1 mmol litre1 allows for optimum clot formation.11 Manipulation of cardiovascular physiology to improve the operative field can reduce blood loss for example [[hypotensive anaesthesia\|hypotensive anaesthesia]] in sinus surgery, or the lowering of [central venous pressure](../../Knowledge/Medicine/Central%20venous%20pressure.md) in [[Knowledge/Medicine/Hepatic resection\|../../Knowledge/Medicine/Hepatic resection]]. Careful patient positioning will improve surgical operating conditions and reduce blood loss, by ensuring that venous drainage is maintained.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TSX4E2H9?page=31&annotation=CD7QV5V7) ([Thakrar et al., 2017, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/DXHK2PDX))

“Where there may be blood loss greater than 1000 ml, the use of intraoperative cell salvage is advocated. Cell salvage is performed with the use of a double lumen suction device to collect blood. Blood is stored within a reservoir with added anticoagulants. Once enough blood is collected RBCs are washed, filtered, suspended in saline, and returned to the patient.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TSX4E2H9?page=31&annotation=32JW8V7K) ([Thakrar et al., 2017, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/DXHK2PDX))

“These inhibit [[fibrinolysis\|fibrinolysis]] by their action at the active sites on [[plasminogen\|plasminogen]], inhibiting the activation of plasmin. [[Knowledge/Medicine/tranexamic acid\|TXA]] should be used prophylactically in major surgery where perioperative blood loss is predicted to be high. TXA has been shown to significantly reduce perioperative blood loss. The clinical randomization of an antifibrinolytic in significant haemorrhage (CRASH-2 trial) highlighted the benefit of early therapy with TXA in trauma induced bleeding. A significant decline in risk of death from haemorrhage with the early use of TXA in the [[trauma\|trauma]] setting has been demonstrated” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TSX4E2H9?page=32&annotation=W68KSKRD) ([Thakrar et al., 2017, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/DXHK2PDX))

“In most surgical specialties, the use of postoperative drains is being reduced, often as a component of enhanced recovery after surgery programmes. The use of drains has been shown to increase blood transfusion rates in [[pages/Orthopaedic surgery\|../../pages/Orthopaedic surgery]].” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TSX4E2H9?page=32&annotation=V5ILEZP3) ([Thakrar et al., 2017, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/DXHK2PDX))

“A ==single unit blood transfusion== policy reduces transfusion rates and improves the economics of blood transfusion” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TSX4E2H9?page=33&annotation=Y4L633R2) ([Thakrar et al., 2017, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/DXHK2PDX))
