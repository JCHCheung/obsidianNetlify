“Although general anaesthesia is still common, using either a reinforced tracheal tube or a laryngeal mask airway, this procedure is increasingly carried out with local anaesthesia, which may be particularly suitable for the patient with marked cardiorespiratory disease. Local anaesthesia may involve cervical nerve blocks or surgical infiltration with or without sedation.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8J2XX5NR?page=57&annotation=5YZEECZZ) ([Malhotra and Sodhi, 2007, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/IAEWBS9R))
