“The X descent is due to 
1. downward movement of the lateral annulus of the TV during RV contraction, and 
2. atrial relaxation. 

It coincides with ST segment on electrocardiogram.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZUJKT5U8?page=1&annotation=R7R9CEXA) ([Raut and Maheshwari, 2014, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/IGS4Q9HH))

“X descent is determined by
1. right atrial function (relaxation),
2. right ventricular function, 
3. volume loading conditioning, and 
4. pericardial forces.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZUJKT5U8?page=2&annotation=RQNUX6B3) ([Raut and Maheshwari, 2014, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/IGS4Q9HH))
