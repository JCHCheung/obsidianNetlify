## Abstract

Anesthetics have profound effects on the brain and central nervous system. Vital signs, along with the electroencephalogram and electroencephalogram-based indices, are commonly used to assess the brain states of patients receiving general anesthesia and sedation. Important information about the patient’s arousal state during general anesthesia can also be obtained through use of the neurologic examination. This article reviews the main components of the neurologic examination focusing primarily on the brainstem examination. It details the components of the brainstem examination that are most relevant for patient management during induction, maintenance, and emergence from general anesthesia. The examination is easy to apply and provides important complementary information about the patient’s arousal level that cannot be discerned from vital signs and electroencephalogram measures.

“Guedel formalized the use of these <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">eye signs and respiratory patterns</mark> to characterize the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anesthetic state for ether</mark> , and ether used in combination with opioids.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=462&annotation=GZAFSQ37) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 462](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“Although <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Guedel’s system no longer applies</mark> to anesthetic states created by modern techniques, anesthesiologists continue refer to the excitatory states seen at times on emergence or on induction as Guedel’s stage two.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=462&annotation=4UEKGZ6R) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 462](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“Patients receiving general anesthesia are placed into and brought out of a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pharmacologically induced coma</mark> .6,7 This suggests that the parts of the neurologic examination that are commonly used by neurologists to assess level of arousal and integrity of brainstem and corticothalamic function in patients in coma, vegetative states, and minimally conscious states should be used to evaluate arousal levels in patients who receive general anesthesia or sedation. Use of the neurologic examination in anesthesia care would place assessments of level of unconsciousness within the same framework used by neurologists to track coma recovery.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=462&annotation=4NIYYWXC) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 462](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“several physiologic changes are commonly observed as the patient becomes unconscious within <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">10 to 30 s</mark> .
- When asked to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">count backwards from 100</mark> , the patient typically loses consciousness between 80 to 90, i.e. stops counting.
- The anesthesiologist can also monitor the transition to unconsciousness by using a task called <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">smooth pursuit</mark> , whereby the patient is instructed to track with his or her eyes the course of the anesthesiologist’s finger through space  along a horizontal line. 
	- As the patient’s level of consciousness declines during smooth pursuit
		- the lateral excursions of the eyes ↓
		- blinking↑
		- and nystagmus may appear.
	- The eyes eventually fix in the midline as the lids close.
	- Almost simultaneously, the patient becomes
		- unresponsive, 
		- atonic, 
		- apneic, 
		- and the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">oculocephalic</mark> (or more precisely vestibular-oculocephalic) (fig. 1A) and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">corneal</mark> (fig. 1B) reflexes are lost.

The pupillary response (fig. 1C) to light may be absent or present. At this point, unresponsiveness is interpreted as unconsciousness. It must be acknowledged that a patient could be in a state of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cognitive motor dissociation</mark> . That is, conscious but unable to respond. Detecting this state would require imaging techniques and behavioral assessments not commonly used in clinical practice.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=463&annotation=AE9LPQGZ) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 463](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“Anesthesiologists’ use of the [[Knowledge/Medicine/eyelash reflex\|eyelash reflex]] is an approximation to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">more precise corneal reflex</mark> ” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=463&annotation=TVJ9KVYH) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 463](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“If the eyes blink consensually, the reflex is intact. If only one eye blinks, the reflex is impaired, and if neither eye blinks, the reflex is absent. The ophthalmic branch of the CN5 carries the afferent signal of the corneal reflex to the sensory nucleus of the CN5. The efferent component of the reflex emanates from the motor nucleus of the CN7. Both of these nuclei are located in the pons.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=463&annotation=AFYHWNAS) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 463](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“The patient loses at approximately the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">same time</mark> 
- consciousness
- oculocephalic and
- corneal reflexes.

The nuclei for the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves, which control the oculocephalic reflex, and the nuclei of the fifth and seventh cranial nerves, which control the corneal reflex, are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">adjacent to the brain’s arousal centers</mark> in the midbrain, pons, and hypothalamus (fig. 2).10 Because the cranial nerve nuclei that govern these reflexes are located close to the arousal centers, it can be inferred that loss of consciousness is partially due to the anesthetic effects on the arousal centers.6,11 This statement is consistent with the neurophysiology of the brainstem and hypothalamic circuits and the pharmacology of the hypnotic agents.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=463&annotation=J8QRLMTC) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 463](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">preoptic area</mark> of the hypothalamus sends GABAergic projections to nearly all of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">arousal centers</mark> .7 These anesthetics also act at GABAergic synapses in the ventral and dorsal respiratory groups of the pons and medulla, causing the apnea that commonly accompanies induction.12 The circuits of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">oculocephalic</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">corneal</mark> reflexes are also under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inhibitory</mark> control by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">GABAergic</mark> interneurons.13 Simultaneous action of the hypnotic agents at these GABAergic synapses explains why the changes in arousal level and apnea occur concomitantly with the loss of these brainstem reflexes.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=463&annotation=4D32KWGA) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 463](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">atonia</mark> observed on induction can be attributed to actions of the anesthetic at <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">multiple GABAergic</mark> sites in the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">motor pathways</mark> running from primary motor cortex to through the brainstem to the spinal cord. However, sites of likely brainstem action are the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reticular nuclei</mark> of the pons and midbrain; lesions in these nuclei, as occur with pontine strokes, are associated with cataplexy14,15 and flaccid paralysis.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=463&annotation=QJ34E6UA) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 463](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“After the hypnotic agent is administered intravenously, it rapidly reaches all parts of the brain. In particular, the agent travels through the two vertebral arteries, which fuse to form the basilar artery, the principal blood supply to the brainstem.11 Many penetrating arteries arise from the basilar artery, travel to the brainstem nuclei carrying the induction agent where it induces the observed physiologic and behavioral changes.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=464&annotation=R8X23PZX) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 464](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“As the patient becomes <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sedated</mark> , the unprocessed electroencephalogram shows <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">beta oscillations (13 to 25 Hz).</mark> The beta oscillations are believed to represent primarily the effects of the induction agent on GABAergic circuits in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cortex</mark> .16 With <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unconsciousness</mark> , the unprocessed electroencephalogram shows profound <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">slow (0.1 to 1 Hz) and delta (1 to 4 Hz) oscillations</mark> .The neurophysiology of these slow-delta oscillations is consistent with the anesthetics acting in the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">brainstem, thalamus, and cortex</mark> to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">decrease excitatory activity</mark> in the cortex, and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">hyperpolarizing thalamic and cortical circuits</mark> .17,18 The slow-delta oscillations may precede or appear at the same time as alpha (8 to 12 Hz) oscillations.

“If there is an inadequate level of general anesthesia (level of antinociception and unconsciousness) for a given level of surgical stimulation, the patient’s heart rate and blood pressure can rise rapidly. The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nociceptive medullary autonomic circuit</mark> —consisting of

“6,21 Similarly, neurologists often assess level of arousal in brain injury patients by applying nociceptive stimuli—nail bed pinches, body pinches, or sternal rubs—to activate the nociceptive medullary autonomic circuit.10,22,23 It is imperative that anesthesiologists understand the nociceptive medullary autonomic circuit because tracking activity in this pathway is the most common method used in clinical practice to track patients’ levels of antinociception and unconsciousness.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=466&annotation=JHHM9GVJ) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 466](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“The afferent branch of the nociceptive medullary autonomic circuit begins with peripheral A-delta and C fibers that carry nociceptive information to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where they synapse on to projection neurons (fig. 3).24 The projection neurons travel in the anterolateral fasciculus and synapse in several brainstem sites, including the nucleus of the tractus solitarius in the medulla.6,21 From the face, nociceptive information is transmitted through the trigeminal ganglia and the nucleus of the fifth cranial nerve, and then, onto the nucleus of the tractus solitarius and other brainstem sites. The nucleus of the tractus solitarius mediates the body’s <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sympathetic output</mark> to the blood vessels and the heart via the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">rostral</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">caudal</mark> portions of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ventral lateral medulla</mark> , which project to the thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglia.This pathway initiates the sympathetic response seen after a nociceptive stimulus.6 Furthermore, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">parasympathetic</mark> outputs from the nucleus of the tractus solitarius project to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">nucleus ambiguus</mark> and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus</mark> which, in turn, projects via the vagus nerve to the heart’s sinoatrial node.6 Finally, the nucleus tractus solitarius sends projections to both the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">periventricular</mark> and the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">supraoptic nuclei</mark> of the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">hypothalamus</mark> which release [[Knowledge/Medicine/vasopressin\|vasopressin]] .25 Hence, the nociceptive stimulus of making the incision in a patients with an inadequate level of antinociception activates the nociceptive medullary autonomic circuit, causing an ↑sympathetic activity and a simultaneous ↓parasympathetic activity that manifest as rapid ↑BP & ↑HR.” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=467&annotation=5V92HX96) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 467](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))

“Recovery of the oculocephalic reflex reflects a recovery of function of the third, fourth, sixth, and eighth (vestibular) cranial nerve nuclei which are responsible for eye movements.10 Because an awake patient may not show an oculocephalic reflex because voluntary control of the eyes has resumed, the best way to assess the function of these cranial nerve nuclei is to ask the patient to track the anesthesiologist’s finger in a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">smooth pursuit maneuver</mark> as described in the Induction section.The ability to move the eyes by voluntarily tracking the anesthesiologist’s finger indicates recovery of function in both the midbrain and pons, as well as certain cortical, cerebellar, and basal ganglia circuits. Moreover, visual tracking in the form of recovery smooth pursuit is an unambiguous sign of conscious awareness; for assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness, it is one of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">most reliable signs</mark> distinguishing vegetative state from minimally conscious state in terms of nonreflexive movements.23 Recovery of function in these brain stem nuclei indirectly offers evidence that the arousal centers in the midbrain, pons, and hypothalamus have likely also recovered function” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIKUNI6P?page=469&annotation=Q954MWJX) ([Reshef et al., 2019, p. 469](zotero://select/library/items/GYJFXS5D))
