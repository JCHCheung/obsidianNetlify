## Abstract

Normally, the lung volume at end-expiration generally approximates the relaxation volume of the respiratory system, ie, the lung volume determined by the static balance between the opposing elastic recoil of the lung and chest wall.1 However, in patients with airflow limitation, the end-expiratory volume may no longer be determined by an equilibrium between static forces. Instead, end-expiratory lung volume may exceed predicted functional residual capacity (FRC), because the rate of lung emptying is slowed and expiration is interrupted by the next inspiratory effort before the patient has exhaled to the static relaxation volume.

“This is termed <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dynamic hyperinflation</mark> , and the factors that determine its development include 
> 1. ↑tidal volume
> 2. ↑time constant (resistance x compliance) for emptying the respiratory system, 
> 3. ↓expiratory time.

Such hyperinflation has a number of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">adverse effects</mark> : 
- the respiratory muscles operate at an unfavorable position on their length-tension curve
- elastic recoil of the chest wall is directed inwards, 

→ thereby causing 
- an extra elastic load; 
- and breathing takes place at the upper, less compliant portion of the pressure-volume curve ofthe lung.

These factors cause a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">decrease in the efficiency</mark> of force generation by the respiratory muscles and an<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> increase in the work of breathing</mark> ” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MB3PQI2?page=449&annotation=UKFK8UJS) ([Tobin and Lodato, 1989, p. 449](zotero://select/library/items/G4KM62UM))

“In the presence of hyperinflation, however, to achieve a decrease in alveolar pressure below ambient pressure, a much greater decrease in pleural pressure is required; this greater decrease in pleural pressure is analogous to the further stretching of an already hyperextended spring. In this setting, if ambient pressure is elevated by the application of external PEEP, inspiration is more easily accomplished because alveolar pressure needs to be decreased only below the level of external PEEP (rather than below zero). Thus, we have the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">paradox</mark> whereby external PEEP, which is most commonly employed to induce hyperinflation in patients with diffuse micro-atelectasis, as in the adult respiratory distress syndrome, is being used to decrease the work of breathing induced by hyperinflation consequent to auto-PEEP!” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MB3PQI2?page=449&annotation=FTV4Q83D) ([Tobin and Lodato, 1989, p. 449](zotero://select/library/items/G4KM62UM))

“in the presence of auto-PEEP, external PEEP should not impede expiratory airflow or cause hyperinflation as long as its value is no higher than the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">critical closing pressure</mark> ” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MB3PQI2?page=450&annotation=HLKMQD8A) ([Tobin and Lodato, 1989, p. 450](zotero://select/library/items/G4KM62UM))

“taking the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">waterfall perspective</mark> in patients with airflow limitation presents a certain irony: the external PEEP appears to function much like <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pressure-support ventilation</mark> , in that it <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">augments inspiration</mark> but is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">functionally absent in expiration</mark> .” [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6MB3PQI2?page=450&annotation=8CUZRE92) ([Tobin and Lodato, 1989, p. 450](zotero://select/library/items/G4KM62UM))
