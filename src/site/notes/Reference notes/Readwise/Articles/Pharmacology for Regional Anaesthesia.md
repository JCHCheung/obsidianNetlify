## Highlights
- In 1943 Lofgren developed lidocaine. This was an amide and had a low risk of allergic reactions. This was followed by mepivacaine (1957), prilocaine (1960), bupivacaine (1963), ropivacaine(1997) and levobupivacaine (2000).

- An easy method to determine if a local anaesthetic is an ester or an amide is to check the prefix. Amides have an ‘i’ in the prefix, esters do not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwq586rdcmjxx1wnb7bb35tr))
- It is four times more potent than lidocaine. Therefore, 0.25% bupivacaine is equipotent with 1% lidocaine ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwq5hp4gz5qtmq5x5bh1qayt))
- MAXIMUM SAFE DOSE OF EPINEPHRINE = 4 MICROGRAMS PER KG. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwq5snv1n19gz9r2rmaa3nky))
