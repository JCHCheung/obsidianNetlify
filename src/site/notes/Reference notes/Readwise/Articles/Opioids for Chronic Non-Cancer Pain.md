## Highlights
- Other effects of long-term opioid therapy have been described in recent years. These include [hypogonadism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypogonadism), [osteoporosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/osteoporosis), [immune suppression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/immunosuppressive-treatment), [cognitive impairment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cognitive-defect), and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3hys3g427q28jchggfmqd9f))
- The exact mechanism and location of OIH is uncertain, but five mechanisms have been suggested: changes in the central glutaminergic system mediated by activation of *N*-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors; increased spinal [dynorphins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dynorphin); activation of descending pathways; genetic mechanisms; and decreased [neurotransmitter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neurotransmitter) reuptake and enhanced nociceptive responses ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3hyv4ty6ndfbmrq94rb5j7y))
