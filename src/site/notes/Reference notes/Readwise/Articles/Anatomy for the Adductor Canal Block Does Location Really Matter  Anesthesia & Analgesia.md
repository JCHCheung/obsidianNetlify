## Highlights
- injectate placed in the distal femoral triangle (FT), proximal to the entrance to the actual adductor canal (AC), is more likely to contact the nerve to vastus medialis (NVM), as this nerve is not separated at this level from the other structures in the AC by any septation or sheath. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw7j3bg1k9p637n27pdxhppv))
- in the AC, the NVM acquires its own fascial investment and is essentially in a different compartment from the saphenous nerve ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw7j3m4xxap6t76h5cda6jgh))
- It is clear that the typical mid-thigh injection point is not at the level of the AC, but rather at the level of the distal FT, as defined anatomically ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw7j4jsqnq3pd95bwpdjn9v4))
- The addition of geniculate blocks to either the distal FT block or the ACB is logical, but the necessity of this has not been established ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw7jdxrw3das34sfgm4n365h))
