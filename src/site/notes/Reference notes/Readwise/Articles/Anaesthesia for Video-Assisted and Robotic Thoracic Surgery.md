## Highlights
- Although the lung will not ‘collapse’ until the [pleura](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/visceral-pleura) is breached, volume loss can be encouraged before surgical incision, increasing pleural retraction pressure and theoretically reducing the risk of direct lung injury at the time of surgical port insertion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx464jwxqx8ykw4e01qd8bmf))
- in thoracic surgery, there is a direct association between duration of OLV and risk of PPC ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx46596fy5a7wq7g450k60rs))
- Techniques for improving lung collapse include:
  • (i)
  ventilating the lungs with 100% O2 before lung isolation to remove nitrogen from the operative lung
  • (ii)
  application of suction to the operative lung: if collapse is difficult in individual lobes, suction can be directed using the fibreoptic bronchoscope to ensure the large airways are clear of secretions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx466eztft3em9wr1acy91y4))
