## Highlights
- in the early embryonic stages arrangement of the bronchial segments was symmetrical: left side was a mirror image of the right the right side had 10 bronchial segments and 2 fissures ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqvfx9jtmemzs4e8sc26pk7k))
- the heart displaces the left middle lobe up rotating the medial and lateral segments into superior and inferior segmental arrangement of the lingula ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqvg11evm7z19snag87cqd08))
- squeezed for space the bronchi delay their branching to a little longer to a more distal location. As a result the left main bronchus is now longer than the right main bronchus and with a more horizontal orientation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqvg5bch9p8t550b1f9kch1z))
- the hostile effect of the heart drawing into the left chest results in the left lung losing one segment and one fissure; two lobes are fused into one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqvg93ef6dz46dwajf00wskw))
