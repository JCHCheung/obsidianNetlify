## Highlights
- Airway-related maternal mortality during obstetric GA is approximately 2.3 per 100,000 GAs for CS compared with one in 180,000 GAs for the general population; mortality after failed intubation is 1% in parturients ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9h5gn0dz0hje6pdv2ss8d1))
- Because of the upward displacement of the diaphragm by the uterus and increase in transverse diameter of the thorax, [functional residual capacity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/functional-residual-capacity) (FRC) is reduced 20% by term. [Minute ventilation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/respiratory-minute-volume) (MV) is increased by 50%. The combination of decreased FRC and increased MV accounts for rapid uptake of [inhalational anaesthetic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/inhalational-anaesthetic) agents ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9hw9p9v63jay0ycad974h5))
- Increased maternal [resting metabolic rate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/resting-metabolic-rate) and the increased metabolic demands of the [fetoplacental unit](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fetoplacental-unit) cause an increase of 60% in oxygen consumption ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9hx16s5zfecrrw7208taqr))
- Cardiac output increases by up to 50% at term, resulting from an increase in HR (10–20 beats min−1) and stroke volume (30–40%). Thus, [induction of anaesthesia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/induction-of-anesthesia) with i.v. anaesthetic agents is faster.

- [Progesterone](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/progesterone) also decreases the tone of the LOS ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9j79egamzy3zg59j05zqpk))
- None of the currently used anaesthetic agents, including [propofol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/propofol), opioids, [neuromuscular blocking agents](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neuromuscular-blocking-agent) (NMBAs), and [local anaesthetics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/spinal-anaesthesia), at standard concentrations, have been shown to have teratogenic effects on the fetus at any gestational age ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9j8x7jr3bgkfz4tp5jrhwm))
- Even in cases of strongly suspected PAS, no association has been found between the degree of placental invasion and massive blood loss or large-volume transfusion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9q1k0d0x3ajw59qxm6qvwd))
- Changes in the patient's mental status (especially progression to unarousable) are likely to correlate with a reduced ability to protect her airway and should be triggers to consider induction of GA ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9q448t40yymc68b8sw61rg))
- Unlike during operative delivery, where [uterine relaxation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/uterus-relaxation) is undesirable, it is a requirement during many fetal surgeries. Uterine relaxation during these cases allows better surgical exposure, maximises maternal blood flow through the uterus, and reduces the chances of uteroplacental separation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9qaeev04csdrd5dy3279nd))
- Uterine relaxation may be achieved with a combination of agents (nitroglycerine, [indomethacin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/indometacin) and magnesium) with [volatile agents](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/volatile-agent) acting as the bedrock of the effort ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9qbq6ee3sq1er6v85sg57g))
