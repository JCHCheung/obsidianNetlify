## Highlights
- *Suspect* **leads V1** *and/or* **V2** have been placed **1 or 2 interspaces*****too high*** on the chest IF *one or more* of the following clues are present:
  • **C****LUE** **#****1** — If there is an **r’** in leads V1 *and/or* V2, especially if the other finding for incomplete RBBB (ie, *terminal s waves in lateral leads I and V6*) is absent.
  • **C****LUE** **#****2** — If there is a significant ***negative*** **component** to the **P wave** in lead V1 *and/or* V2.
  • **C****LUE** **#****3** — If the appearance of the QRS complex and the ST-T wave in leads V1 and V2 looks *very much like* the QRS and ST-T wave in **lead aVR.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpz6r9hexy1mkfst3a97dzrb))
- There may normally be a negative component to the **P wave** in leads V1 *and/or* V2 — especially if atrial size *and/or* pressure is increased (ie, *one of the ECG criteria for left atrial abnormality is a deep negative component to the P wave in lead V1*). That said, *most* of the time — the depth and width of a “normal” negative component to the P wave in leads V1 *and/or* V2 will *not* be nearly as prominent ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpz6sz1hw6dfj27sdz8hb193))
- Physiologically — the presence of a ***terminal*** **r' deflection** means that the last component of ventricular depolarization (*from the viewpoint of leads V1 and V2*) is directed toward the right (ie, *toward the right ventricular outflow track*). An r’ in lead V1 (*and even incomplete RBBB*) are *not* necessarily abnormal findings in a small but significant percentage of otherwise young, healthy adults — since ventricular depolarization of this portion of the RV is sometimes slightly delayed relative to LV depolarization as a normal phenomenon.
