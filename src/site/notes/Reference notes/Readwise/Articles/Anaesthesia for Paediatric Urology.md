## Highlights
- A deep plane of anaesthesia and adequate analgesia is important before insertion of the cystoscope as urethral stimulation may precipitate laryngospasm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1tfx81kqevs5m4wd9sxz2x))
- In conditions with a high incidence of associated spinal abnormalities, for example, cloacal exstrophy, imaging should be undertaken before considering central neuraxial block for analgesia. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsrvhvyx17y1frwqrm5hgtw))
- Laparoscopic procedures produce intense surgical stimulation until almost the end of surgery. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1tkx4d1azpm3nrp7kc7px5))
- Hypospadias is a relatively common congenital defect with an incidence of 1:350 male births.[1](javascript:;) The urinary meatus is on the undersurface of the penis (ventral) and there may be an associated downward curvature of the penis, called chordee. Surgical correction is performed at 6â€“18 months of age ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnsrxx4504k2dznsgmy8rgre))
- Severe hypospadias with unilateral or bilateral impalpable testes or ambiguous genitalia requires genetic and endocrine investigations to exclude congenital adrenal hyperplasia ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnss0h037x92hf6hztenxczk))
- General anaesthesia (GA) is frequently combined with a regional anaesthetic technique for hypospadias correction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnssa0nbmq04j4j7jgdrf4bw))
- For hypospadias repair, caudal extradural block is effective and reduces the requirement for postoperative supplementary opioid administration ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnssb402731nyr5xj08enx1v))
- Penile nerve block may be suitable only if the hypospadias is distal and is associated with a lower incidence of urinary retention compared with a caudal block ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnssc70nzvkx8spxh6z79qmm))
- Latex, a natural rubber, is the sap of the tree, *Hevea brasiliensis*, and is used in the manufacture of rubber gloves and other medical products. Sensitization may occur due to early and prolonged exposure to products containing latex ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnssvnepk676fmba843qs3gq))
- Children undergoing repeated surgery, particularly in the first year of life, are at greater risk of developing latex allergy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnssv9scdrvd4h2xx0bparjt))
- Caudal block is useful for analgesia after infraumbilical operations (T10). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnssz32x43px86zgyam6k3m7))
