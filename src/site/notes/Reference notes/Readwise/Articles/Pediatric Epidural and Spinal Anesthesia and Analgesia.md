## Highlights
- Pre-assessment is particularly useful in screening children with cutaneous stigmata of spinal dysraphism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr2w057n1q5133j7w35dkncf))
- there is a secondary spread of local anesthetic in the epidural space. This occurs in two patterns: a horizontal intrasegmental redistribution from the dorsal to ventral epidural space and a delayed longitudinal cranial spread as the dura returns to its original position, thus pushing the epidural local anesthetic cephalad.

- The use of a styletted needle may reduce the risk of introducing a dermal plug into the caudal space, although an epidermal cell graft tumor in the epidural space has yet to be reported ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1xf05yv48kqa7038hrqfnk))
