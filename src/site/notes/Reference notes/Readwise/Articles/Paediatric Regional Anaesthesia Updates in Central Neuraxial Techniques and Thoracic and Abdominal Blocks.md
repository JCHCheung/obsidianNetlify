## Highlights
- The conus medularis will extend to L4 in premature infants, L3 in a term neonate, but by 1 yr of age, it will be nearer its adult location of L1 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1vdfkm62fg5s6e13372yfk))
- dural sac extends lower in premature babies and neonates (to around S4), whereas by age 2 yrs it has developed to its adult location at S2 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1vdnk7130j21e42kmm3f5w))
- The absence of thoracic [kyphosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/kyphosis) in infants means greater cephalad spread of injected drugs, extending the dermatomal coverage of a central neuraxial block ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1vdstj6d3987dj4wfv6qey))
- The neonatal [cerebrospinal fluid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cerebrospinal-fluid) volume (4 ml kg−1) is twice that of adults (2 ml kg−1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1vdz73jm9nkfzk2vqvx8se))
- The [vascularity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vascularity) of the [pia mater](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pia-mater) combined with greater cardiac output leads to faster local anaesthetic (LA) reabsorption, and thus, shorter block duration ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1ve2zqnqqk4qy7cejx0nkz))
- The immaturity of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system in infants means that the [chemical sympathectomy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/chemical-sympathectomy) of central neuraxial anaesthesia does not result in the [vasoplegia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vasoplegia), hypotension, or cardiovascular instability sometimes seen in adults. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1ve69gr53gz04xqja7gt2d))
- Caudal blocks represent the most common form of regional anaesthesia in children with a low failure rate (1%); low complication rate (1.9%); and excellent safety profile consisting of cardiovascular or central nervous toxicity of 0.02% ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1vg05fbshnr2e20fpgn5j1))
- The ASRA/ESRA recommends ropivacaine (0.2%) or levobupivacaine/bupivacaine (0.25%) in volumes not exceeding 1 ml kg−1 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1vgaad0mbdvtcfs03hnffx))
- The classic Armitage regimen of caudal dosing of bupivacaine 0.25% at 0.5 ml kg−1 for sacro-lumbar block, 1 ml kg−1 for abdominal block, and 1.2 ml kg−1 for mid-thoracic block is poorly predictive for cranial extension of LA ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1vhg5bqpar6ah8wzd3s8a6))
- Pudendal-nerve-block success rates are reported >85% amongst consultants and non-consultants; however, this compares poorly to caudal success rates of 99% ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1vqgcjf3mre7ch3t3tt43v))
