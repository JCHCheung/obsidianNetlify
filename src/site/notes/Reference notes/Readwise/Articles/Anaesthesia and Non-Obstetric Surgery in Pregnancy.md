## New highlights added August 13, 2023 at 5:15 PM
- Commonly used preoperative medications, including [benzodiazepines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/benzodiazepine) or opioids, may be safely offered without concern for fetal [cleft palate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cleft-palate) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxn7bns798wg0fcph0tq585e))
- The second trimester is preferred for non-elective surgery. Patients are considered to be at the lowest risk for [preterm delivery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/premature-labor), surgical exposure is enhanced as the uterus is lower in the abdomen, and major embryonic development is complete by the eighth week ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxn7c22wzdak0nq43msbd86k))
- [NSAIDs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/nonsteroid-antiinflammatory-agent) should be avoided after 32 weeks of gestation because of concerns for premature patent [ductus arteriosus closure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ductus-arteriosus-obliteration) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnb98p2jtdmvjnr1pq20vwx))
- Mucosal [friability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/friability) and oedema occur early in the [first trimester](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/first-trimester-pregnancy) and are most prominent in the [third trimester](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/third-trimester-pregnancy).[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2058534920301438#bib5) Nasal [intubation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/intubation), regardless of trimester, is not recommended, as increased [vascularity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vascularity) can cause [epistaxis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/epistaxis). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnbbaxtmwhkga053wgha8b3))
- Respiratory changes begin in the first trimester and continue to have an effect throughout pregnancy. Maternal oxygen consumption increases steadily to meet the demands of the growing fetus. Increased [minute ventilation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/respiratory-minute-volume), driven mostly by increased [tidal volumes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/tidal-volume), leads to compensated [respiratory alkalosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/respiratory-alkalosis) with a pH nearing 7.44.[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2058534920301438#bib5) This should guide ventilatory settings to a target *P*e′co2 of 3.7–4.3 kPa during [general anaesthesia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/general-anaesthesia) or [blood gas analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/blood-gas-analysis). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnbcrpghm87mravt5gpvjxx))
- Cardiac output increases by 50% above baseline by the end of the [second trimester](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/second-trimester-pregnancy), which may predispose patients with [congenital heart anomalies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/congenital-heart-defect), heart failure or valve disease to dysrhythmia or worsening heart failure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnbdgjeeddchrx20a33ebga))
- Gastric emptying and [acid secretion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acid-secretion) do not change before labour regardless of the patient’s BMI. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnbepaq45nka0mc98amx0wd))
- Lower oesophageal [sphincter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/sphincter) tone decreases with [progesterone](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/progesterone) concentrations and reaches a nadir at 36 weeks.[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2058534920301438#bib5) Combined with the accompanying mechanical displacement of the stomach by the gravid uterus, the patient is at increased risk for regurgitation and aspiration. In addition, 80% of patients can experience nausea and vomiting as early as 4 weeks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnbfmsmcxbrwhrht7428m1x))
- [rapid sequence induction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rapid-sequence-induction) with aspiration prophylaxis should be considered in any trimester if the patient is experiencing nausea, vomiting, pain, infection, and gastro-oesophageal reflux; has a history of [hiatus hernia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hiatus-hernia); or has a full stomach ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnbg3b0tt5zfs4ecgqn7g0z))
- [Inferior vena cava](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/inferior-vena-cava) compression as early as 13–16 weeks has been reported ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnbh5qzd571jnq4qks67am3))
- CO2 insufflation confers a higher risk of [hypercarbia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypercapnia).[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2058534920301438#bib7) Hypercarbia, hypotension and [hypoxaemia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypoxemia) may lead to [vasoconstriction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vasoconstriction) and subsequent reduction in uteroplacental perfusion, which may lead to [fetal distress](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fetus-distress).[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2058534920301438#bib2) Consequences of CO2 [pneumoperitoneum](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pneumoperitoneum) can be reduced by keeping insufflation pressures between 12 and 15 mmHg, and maintaining baseline maternal *P*aco2 and [arterial blood pressure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/arterial-pressure) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnbk0qvg5k8d0apzevawrmf))
- Hypotension may be treated with either [phenylephrine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/phenylephrine) or [ephedrine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ephedrine), as both are safe for use in pregnancy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnbk51p1j1dpkga4tsnvwtq))
- Cardiac output may reach values 150% above pregnancy baseline immediately postpartum and may take up to 24 weeks to return to normal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnpt70bvxw4qr40456n2xhm))
- Maternal heart rate stabilises within 2 weeks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnptcf55g2s9g6z803vhkfm))
- The dilutional anaemia seen throughout the pregnancy resolves by 3 weeks postpartum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnpthr7h4jvpjjrbfpq2cme))
- Gastric emptying, volume and pH return to pre-pregnancy levels at 18 h postpartum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxnptn0fvjwsk36j7y4dd4ar))
