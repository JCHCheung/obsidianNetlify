## Highlights
- Note that the **Tp** is *oppositely* directed to the **P wave** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt4q6xy2w9pvjq0ny8s8x2zz))
- The size of the Tp wave will be proportional to the size of its P wave ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt4q7fhw307sm8r2p1f8kcna))
- normal *duration* of the Ta wave is significantly longer (*up to 2-3 times longer*) than normal P wave duration ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gt4qa05jstvp8yqwpda6mk33))
