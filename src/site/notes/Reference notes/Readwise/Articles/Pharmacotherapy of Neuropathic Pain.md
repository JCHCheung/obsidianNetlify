## Highlights
- Arguably the most commonly prescribed group of drugs for NeP are the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which produce blockade of serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby increasing the activity of the descending inhibitory pain pathways ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3ht70n5qeh87nhekem770x2))
- Gabapentin binds to a subunit (α2δ) of voltage dependent calcium channels in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Since gabapentin is not bound to plasma proteins, there are no significant interactions with other drugs—a valuable advantage when many patients with NeP are taking a large number of other medications. In addition to its proven role in reducing neuropathic pain, it offers the added benefits of mood enhancement and improved sleep patterns ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3hth1m41h7kw8ncamnwryy0))
