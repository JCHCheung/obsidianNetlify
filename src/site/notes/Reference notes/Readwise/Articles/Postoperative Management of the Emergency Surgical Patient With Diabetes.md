- In the UK, the VRIII is the standard way of managing diabetes perioperatively. It should be used in the following circumstances:
  • Patient with Type 1 diabetes undergoing surgery with a starvation period greater than 1 missed meal.
  • Patient with Type 1 diabetes undergoing surgery who has not received background insulin.
  • Patient with Type 2 diabetes undergoing surgery with a starvation period greater than 1 missed meal and develops significant hyperglycaemia (CBG > 12 mmol litre−1).
  • Patients with poorly controlled diabetes as defined as a HbA1c > 8.5% (69 mmol mol−1). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gped8eb6q8201xajnb3bx3a7))
