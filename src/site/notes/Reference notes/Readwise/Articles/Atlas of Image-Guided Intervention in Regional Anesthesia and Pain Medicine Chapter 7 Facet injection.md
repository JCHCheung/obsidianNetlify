## Highlights
- The sensory innervation to the facet joints is anatomi-
  cally predictable, and the sensory nerves are easily acces-
  sible from the dorsal surface of the body ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2v3ttx02qvcnkpr1pdc0egq))
- The anterior
  ramus contains the majority of sensory and motor Ô¨Å bers
  at each vertebral level ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2v3w1aayhngw8v2wag44fb3))
- The posterior primary ramus, in
  turn, divides into a lateral branch that provides innerva-
  tion to the paraspinous musculature and a small, variable
  sensory branch to the skin overlying the spinous processes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2v3xrqjq2vrqnh6jjemmcx0))
- the medial branch of the posterior primary ramus courses
  over the base of the transverse process where it joins with
  the superior articular process of the facet joint and courses
  along the articular process to supply sensation to the joint. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2v3xk1xe5pp0ewccj7415pk))
- Each facet joint receives sensory innervation from the
  medial branch nerve at the same vertebral level, as well as
  from a descending branch from the vertebral level above;
  thus, two medial branch nerves must be blocked to anes-
  thetize each facet joint, for example, medial branch blocks
  at the base of the L4 and L5 transverse processes are needed
  to anesthetize the L4/L5 facet joint ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2v3z08fxa899n83mzh3sb7g))
- The pain caused by facet arthropathy is most
  pronounced over the axis of the spine itself and is typically
  maximal directly in the region of the most affected joints ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2v41jahser0qkjdh423y5m1))
- Conventional radiofrequency treatment produces a
  small area of tissue coagulation surrounding the active tip
  of an insulated cannula ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2v4bjcgzjnhsspecp3yvr1a))
- By applying the radiofre-
  quency energy in intermittent pulses, the voltage energy
  can be delivered without heating of the tissue or resultant
  tissue coagulation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2v4detzdhta5ncbmqkvhsbv))
- The
  lesion produced by conventional radiofrequency is along
  the shaft of the needle surrounding the active tip (see
  Fig. 7-20). There is scant tissue destruction at the tip of the
  needle; thus, the shaft of the active tip of the cannula must
  be placed along the course of the nerve ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2v4f48kshgad3ftnsmfz87f))
- the
  highest density of voltage change during pulsed radiofre-
  quency emanates directly from the tip of the radiofrequency
  cannula; thus, the tip of the needle should be directed along
  the course of the nerve to be treated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2v4ev2kt4v0ypfk51g70spq))
- The medial branch nerves to the lumbar facets course over
  the base of the transverse process, where they join with
  the superior articular processes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2v4gvvrnmkhj1ntry8p8a6m))
