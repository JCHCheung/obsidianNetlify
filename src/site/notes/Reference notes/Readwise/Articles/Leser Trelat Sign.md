## Highlights
- The sign of Leser-Trelat was first described by in the 1800s by Edmund Leser and Ulysse Trelat, but instead of eruptive seborrheic keratoses, they were studying the presence of cherry angiomas in oncology patients. In 1900, Hollander was the first to describe seborrheic keratoses in association with malignancy, but the names Leser and Trelat remained affixed to the condition.
- The sign of Leser-Trelat may precede, occur concurrently, or start after the diagnosis of malignancy. The most commonly implicated malignancies include gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (gastric, colon, rectal), with gastric adenocarcinoma being the overall most common malignancy, followed by breast cancer, and lymphoproliferative disorders/lymphoma.
