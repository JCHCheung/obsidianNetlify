## Highlights
- Patients with [anaerobic threshold](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/anaerobic-threshold) less than 11 ml min−1 kg−1 are at a higher risk of cardiac complications ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4cz7y056t51tfxy628b8285))
- Nutritional therapy is indicated if the BMI is less than 18.5, [weight loss](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/weight-loss) greater than 10% of body weight, or if inadequate food intake is likely after surgery ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4d3ny775jerg6kz8tk3a1sq))
- The theoretical advantage of gas induction is that it is a slow induction that preserves spontaneous ventilation, and if at any point airway obstruction does occur, then the delivery of the [inhaled anaesthetic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/inhaled-anesthetics) ceases and the patient can theoretically wake up. The NAP-4 report highlighted that, in practice, when total airway obstruction occurs, patients do not exhale the [anaesthetic gases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/anesthetic-gas) and [hypoxia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypoxia) rapidly ensues ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4d42d704w6hh3r8ffrvh5dx))
- In free flap transfer, both the skin and the core bladder temperatures are measured to ensure that the core–periphery gradient is less than 1.5°. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4d692p4q4d8mmqxq760y2wv))
- Submental intubation for improved access to the oral cavity is an absolute contraindication in cancer surgery because of the risk of creating an orocutaneous [fistula](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fistula). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4dbty7r5739q0sw98jfxx2k))
- Free flap transfer
  The aim of anaesthetic management is to maintain a full, hyperdynamic circulation with increased cardiac output, peripheral [vasodilation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vasodilatation), and normothermia to maximize ﬂap perfusion. The haematocrit is maintained at 30–35% to improve oxygen transfer and red cell velocity within the [microcirculation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/microcirculation) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4dcknv3tea76qvya8f7psck))
- The absolute contraindications for free ﬂap transfer are [sickle cell disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/sickle-cell-disease) and untreated [polycythaemia rubra vera](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/polycythemia-vera), because [flap failure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/graft-failure) rate is high from microcirculatory ‘sludging’ and [hypercoagulability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypercoagulability). The incidence of anastomotic thrombosis is high in patients with active vasculitis associated with [collagen vascular disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/collagen-vascular-disorder); therefore, specialist referral and treatment is indicated before surgery. With [peripheral vascular disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/peripheral-vascular-disease), magnetic resonanace [angiography](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/angiography) is indicated to determine patency of [donor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/donor) vessels in the [fibular flap](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fibula-graft) for [mandibular reconstruction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mandible-reconstruction) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4ddvdssjdrqkwr2zxa32zyw))
- Other complications of [thyroid surgery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/thyroid-surgery) include postoperative [hypocalcaemia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypocalcaemia) and [tracheomalacia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/tracheomalacia) in long-standing tracheal compression ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4df0tgzcf7j5a8ratdvbhmc))
- The aims of postoperative care in free flap surgery are maintenance of normotension, normothermia with adequate filling, and regular monitoring of the flap. The haematocrit should be maintained at 30–35% (dextran and [aspirin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acetylsalicylic-acid) are no longer given because of lack of proof of efficacy). Nutritional support should be commenced as soon as possible after surgery ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4dfavdbgk758fzpfs2a73je))
