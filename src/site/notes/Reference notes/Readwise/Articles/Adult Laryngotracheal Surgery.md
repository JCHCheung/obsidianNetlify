## Highlights
- The primary function of the larynx involves phonation, respiration, and deglutition ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kj383efbnff3eweymtj2bt))
- The larynx is divided into three anatomic regions: (1) supraglottis, which includes the lingual and laryngeal surface of the epiglottis, the aryepiglottic folds, the arytenoid cartilages, the false vocal folds, and the ventricle; (2) glottis, composed of true vocal cords and the anterior and posterior commissures; and (3) subglottis, which has no subcomponents and is the area of the larynx inferior to the glottis down to the inferior rim of the cricoid cartilage.

- Voice changes occur late in supraglottic tumors, and usually signify direct extension to the cricoarytenoid joint or paraglottic space involvement ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kk6qv1q50gp2grnvemm9qf))
- Dysphagia and odynophagia are the most common symptoms and can suggest extension to the tongue base or to the hypopharynx ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kk71gy4rz54wnt57tn37ck))
- Due to the paucity of lymphatic drainage of the cords, glottic carcinomas often remain localized and have a less frequent rate of cervical metastasis. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4kk7pznabmsstpakfx3as41))
