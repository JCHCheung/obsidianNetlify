## Highlights
- Drug distribution depends on regional blood flow, cardiac output, body composition, age, and the physiochemical properties of the drug, such as lipid solubility, [protein binding](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/protein-binding), molecular size, pKa, and degree of ionisation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6ck1anj7xd8hmy3t15r3sp))
- Redistribution of blood away from peripheral tissues with or without reduction in cardiac output can decrease the volume of distribution (VD) of some fat-soluble medications leading to higher plasma concentrations and the potential for adverse effects ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6cm9mtg0qwfqdj47cthw76))
- Endothelial damage, altered [capillary permeability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/capillary-permeability), and fluid leak in combination with fluid resuscitation may significantly increase the VD of hydrophilic medications (e.g. beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics), which can lead to decreased plasma concentrations and potential underdosing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6cm0enm6nzzv8aj1cfhka6))
- The degree of ionisation is determined by p*K*a and affects lipophilicity, the extent to which a drug can cross membranes and its VD ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6cn6n0gmvhf42gk7pnnyzf))
- [Acidaemia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/organic-acidemia), frequently found in sepsis, therefore leads to an increased degree of ionisation of drugs that are weak bases (e.g. opioids, local anaesthetics) and a decreased volume of distribution. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6cq3vwhbcrn3xg7t7zyx0d))
- Most drugs are metabolised predominantly in the liver, but extrahepatic sites may be important. For example, [propofol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/propofol) has a clearance in excess of [hepatic blood flow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/liver-blood-flow), as it is metabolised in the lungs and kidneys ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6dkhpk6jexernepyr4c3ms))
- The [pathophysiology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pathophysiology) of [hepatic dysfunction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/liver-dysfunction) in sepsis is complex and not fully understood. Two clinical entities may be observed. An imbalance in hepatic oxygen delivery and demand accompanied by a reduced ability of hepatocytes to extract oxygen leads to *hypoxic hepatitis*, characterised by increased [aminotransferase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/transaminase) concentrations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6dt40rjqy1h8kp2es89cjs))
- [cytochrome P450](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cytochrome-p450) (CYP450) systems located in the pericentral area of the [liver lobule](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/liver-lobule) are at risk of cellular hypoxia ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6dvct16tf6tsy0xe88wkw1))
- Adrenaline (epinephrine), [vasopressin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vasopressin), and [positive pressure ventilation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/continuous-positive-airway-pressure) all reduce hepatic blood flow, and therefore the clearance of drugs with a high ER such as [fentanyl](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fentanyl) and propofol ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6drnea1zjxezms3xsd1c3d))
- [Renal excretion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/urinary-excretion) comprises filtration, secretion, and reabsorption, with filtration being the primary mechanism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6e0zev6mcvady2qydtcxbn))
- In contrast, [renal drug](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/renal-agent) clearance may be augmented by increased renal blood flow associated with a hyperdynamic circulation in early sepsis, leading to increased clearance of hydrophilic molecules and under-dosage ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6e49v1qs2dq6ss9smtnb3g))
- Active secretion of drugs by the [renal tubule](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/renal-tubule) is an energy-dependent process requiring adequate renal blood flow, and so elimination may be reduced in AKI and sepsis. Drugs with significant [renal secretion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/kidney-tubule-excretion) include β-lactam antibiotics, [digoxin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/digoxin), and [furosemide](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/furosemide) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6e4s1cqnxj0tbke03cadmy))
- Pharmacokinetics may be altered as a consequence of reduced [renal clearance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/renal-clearance) and alterations in [plasma protein binding](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/plasma-protein-binding), acid–base balance, and volume of distribution, together with the accumulation of [organic acids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/carboxylic-acid) such as uric and lactic acid ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6e7waapa31v676n7kebzsv))
- [Propofol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/propofol), [thiopental](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/thiopental), and [etomidate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/etomidate) are highly lipid-soluble molecules with extensive [protein binding](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/protein-binding) (propofol 98% bound to albumin). In severe sepsis, VD is initially decreased as a consequence of centralisation of blood flow. This combined with a decreased [serum albumin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/serum-albumin) can lead to significantly higher free plasma concentrations in patients with sepsis, causing pronounced [cardiovascular effects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cardiovascular-effect). Decreased cardiac output also prolongs time to [induction of anaesthesia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/induction-of-anesthesia), and doses should be reduced, given slowly, and titrated to effect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6edh6e6nbv6qnapxrsfsx3))
- Thiopental has a pKa of 7.6, and is 61% unionised at physiological pH. [Acidosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acidosis) may therefore increase the unionised fraction and theoretically increase its clinical effects, including a greater risk of cardiovascular depression ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6eh84x7ymsrnq68apxsz65))
- Renal and [hepatic dysfunction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/liver-dysfunction) have limited effects on the metabolism and clearance of propofol, and its metabolites are inactive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6ej29c2stzdqtkfrwwfa4s))
- [Ketamine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ketamine), unlike the other i.v. agents, can be administered via several routes. Protein binding is 25% and therefore [hypoproteinaemia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypoproteinemia) has little effect. Ketamine is metabolised by the [cytochrome P450](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cytochrome-p450) system to an [active metabolite](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/active-metabolite), norketamine, with approximately one-third the potency of the parent compound, and so clinical effect may be prolonged in [severe hepatic impairment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/severe-hepatic-impairment). Norketamine is conjugated to inactive metabolites that are excreted in the urine ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6ep5y8w8cxaygmn8zj4jb9))
- [Benzodiazepines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/benzodiazepine) are lipophilic and >95% bound to [albumin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/albumin). Hypoalbuminaemia causes a significant (up to three-fold) increase in VD, allowing free drug to distribute throughout [adipose tissue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/adipose-tissue), prolonging half-life and [pharmacodynamic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pharmacodynamics) effect. Despite increased VD, the decrease in protein binding leads to higher initial free plasma concentrations, with a rapid pharmacological response ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6evtey1rdzkagkw4hrd9qc))
- Hypoproteinaemia will prolong the duration of all non-depolarising NMBAs because of an increase in VD ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6f0cdfv73jzwq0ptjt657s))
- [Hypokalaemia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypokalemia), [hypocalcaemia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypocalcaemia), [hypermagnesaemia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypermagnesemia), acidosis, and hypothermia (particularly with atracurium) prolong the effect of NMBAs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6f0r77mk2pc8z4nt584vec))
- [Succinylcholine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/suxamethonium) is rapidly hydrolysed by plasma [cholinesterases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cholinesterase) after administration, to the extent that approximately only 20% of an administered dose reaches the [neuromuscular junction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neuromuscular-junction) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6f1rxrbzvj9fnt4xhtmwqe))
- Acquired plasma cholinesterase deficiency occurs in sepsis; renal, hepatic, and cardiac failure; and [protein malnutrition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/kwashiorkor) (amongst many other causes), with the potential for prolonged [neuromuscular block](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neuromuscular-blocking) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6f2bhp74kbn8kg9xxdb41n))
- [Neostigmine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neostigmine) is a highly ionised molecule with low protein binding. Dose adjustment is not required. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6f3ba7gh67sqw8yjdm0f1d))
- Sugammadex and the sugammadex–NMBA complex do not bind to [plasma proteins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/blood-proteins) and are not metabolised. The complex is 96% excreted via the kidneys and is cleared by [renal replacement therapy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/renal-replacement-therapy) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6f3zk7mqtrr1q1em59seqd))
- Molecules with a high affinity for [sugammadex](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/sugammadex), such as [flucloxacillin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/flucloxacillin), [toremifene](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/toremifene), and intravenous [fusidic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fusidic-acid), may displace rocuronium or vecuronium from the sugammadex–NMBA complex. This may lead to a delay in recovery of train-of-four, or the potential for recurarisation, although this has not been observed in clinical practice ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6f59jn92rx0ggvykkf6t1j))
- Weak bases (such as opioids) are bound to AAG, an [acute phase reactant](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acute-phase-protein) whose concentration increases in cases of [critical illness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/critical-illness). An increase in AAG leads to a decreased VD and decreased clearance, prolonging duration of action in sepsis ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6fhw66ttcf9e3fra714sxk))
- Pharmacokinetic variability may be a less important concept when considering the vasoactive agents given their short half-lives and clinically titratable effects, but [tachyphylaxis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/tachyphylaxis) does occur ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6fm8ezb1vwx6c14dzc2qk8))
- Vascular hyporesponsiveness describes a decreased dose–response relationship, and its aetiology is multifactorial. In patients with sepsis it includes downregulation of [catecholamine receptors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/catecholamine-receptor), increased [nitric oxide](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/nitric-oxide) and [prostacyclin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prostacyclin) production, generation of oxygen free radicals and [peroxynitrite](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/peroxynitrite), and the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels caused by acidaemia and increased circulating lactate; this leads to hyperpolarisation of cell membranes and [vasodilatation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vasodilatation) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv6fnkywegs6471g6qh54b03))
- Lipophilic antimicrobials ([Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2058534918301173#tbl4)) may also require dose adjustment in cases of hepatic failure.[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2058534918301173#bib8) For example [metronidazole](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/metronidazole) should be reduced to one-third of the normal dose and administered once daily.
