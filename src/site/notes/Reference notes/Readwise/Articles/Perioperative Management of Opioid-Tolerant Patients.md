## Highlights
- pain management plan for opioid tolerant patients requires careful consideration in the [perioperative period](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/perioperative-period) in order to (i) prevent opioid withdrawal, (ii) provide effective analgesia, and (iii) to ensure continuity of care in the community [after discharge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/afterdischarge) from hospital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0ah25cjrjp3vy8ssv4mye2n))
- [Ketamine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ketamine) is recommended in the acute pain management of opioid-tolerant patients as it has been shown to reduce postoperative opioid use and pain scores ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0ah8qvczasw8eskgveytc44))
- Activation of the *N*-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is believed to be one of the mechanisms for the development of opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). Ketamine is a non-competitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor and can attenuate both of these phenomena ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0ahabqg3vfy44hcek4ev2y6))
- It is generally recommended that the patient's baseline opioid (usually a sustained-release form) is continued in the postoperative period and that acute post-surgical pain is managed with the addition of appropriate doses of IR opioids ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0ahdj01xrws0ab1r53pvekp))
- Direct heat applied to the patch, for example, via perioperative warming devices may enhance drug administration, whereas the use of a patch over an area of poor-perfusion or reduced temperature can reduce drug delivery ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0ahe590s9y73q1n95mcqfrx))
- The use of a buprenorphine patch (up to 70 μg h−1) is unlikely to interfere with the use of full opioid agonists for acute pain management and these should also be continued in the perioperative period ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0ahf1t1wyaskb11aqvwn3yt))
- In the postoperative period, opioid-tolerant patients may require a greater amount of IR oral opioids than is usually expected. Traditionally, the ‘as required’ (p.r.n.) dose is calculated based on the cumulative oral opioid dose given in the preceding 24 h with one-sixth of the total dose prescribed 4 hourly ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0ahkjsjscx0m7s0ks3psagb))
- Rotation can lead to both a reduction in side-effects and an improvement in pain relief because an individual may respond differently to an alternative opioid due to the phenomenon of incomplete cross-tolerance. Cross-tolerance is the observation that exposure to a particular drug (e.g. opioid) results in tolerance to the effects of structurally similar drugs in the same class (e.g. other opioids). When cross-tolerance is incomplete, patients may not have tolerance to the alternative drug. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0ahr0vw9jmqqvmffc72yz8k))
- When performing an opioid rotation, it is recommended to reduce the calculated equianalgesic dose by 30–50% because of the possibility of incomplete cross-tolerance. Patients can use additional IR opioids if necessary. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0ahsdarndjha1m3dn7ys7f1))
- A typical strategy for returning to oral medication is to identify the i.v. opioid consumption in the previous 24 h and convert this to an equivalent oral dose. Fifty per cent of this oral equivalent dose is then given in a sustained-release form, and one-sixth of the equivalent dose is prescribed as an IR preparation every 4 h ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bbzwt211qvpp879cymx0zz))
- patients with OIH may report more diffuse and widespread pain and ‘sensitivity’ which does not respond to an increase in the dose of opioid. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bc76bkmk6njz8bvzbp5y45))
- Methadone is typically started (specialist only) at a dose of between 10 and 40 mg, and increased in 10 mg increments (max 30 mg week−1) to a typical [maintenance dose](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/maintenance-drug-dose) of between 60 and 120 mg day−1 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bca1r9q9my2tkgce2y4h83))
- [Buprenorphine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/buprenorphine) as a maintenance therapy is typically administered as an SL dose between 0.8 and 4 mg (max 32 mg) with typical maintenance doses of between 12 and 24 mg ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bcb4wv4vtsq0969m2axktg))
- Methadone is a μ**-**agonist as well as an NMDA-antagonist and [monoamine reuptake inhibitor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/monoamine-reuptake-inhibitor). It is metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites by [CYP3A4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cyp3a4), which is saturated at low concentrations, and itself also weakly inhibited by methadone ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bccvex1h89jgj4x8bp12d2))
- OIH was first observed in patients taking methadone for [opioid addiction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/opioid-dependence). The underlying mechanism is complex but likely to involve a combination of [glial cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/glial-cells) activation, NMDA receptor activation, glutaminergic activation, and alterations in opioid [intracellular signalling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/intracellular-signaling) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3hwp6ejmqg2crsqa6k5y70d))
- [Buprenorphine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/buprenorphine) is a [partial agonist](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/partial-agonist) at μ**-**receptors, and an antagonist at κ and [δ receptors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/delta-opiate-receptor). It has a high affinity for [opioid receptors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/kappa-opioid-receptor), and dissociates slowly resulting in an extended duration of action. It is used in [addiction medicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/addiction-medicine) to suppress opioid withdrawal and craving for 24–48 h, and is less sedating and euphoric ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bce7fxxg3pd62asx0m3n3s))
- It is recommended to stop naltrexone 72 h prior to surgery, and it is important to note that although patients may be resistant to opioids while taking naltrexone, they may then become extremely opioid sensitive once stopping it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0bcqgd4g9ecd0wppem0gqzz))
