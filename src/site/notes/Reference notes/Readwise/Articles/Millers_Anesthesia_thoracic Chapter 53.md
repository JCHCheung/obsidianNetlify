## Highlights
- At the time of initial assessment, cancer patients should be
  assessed for the “4 Ms” associated with malignancy (Box
  53.4): mass effects, metabolic abnormalities, metastases,
  and medications. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx424cej0a4apw0tzj55ffk0))
- A properly sized, left-sided DLT should
  have a bronchial tip 1 to 2 mm smaller than the patient’s left
  bronchus diameter to allow for the space occupied by the
  deflated bronchial cuff ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx447s69kyfd7s862vhpmpb9))
- In adults,
  depth, measured at the teeth, for a properly positioned DLT,
  will be approximately 12 + (patient height/10) cm ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx44c0ftyxhe1r2gd5fynmjy))
- In a healthy, conscious, spontaneously breathing patient,
  the ventilation of the dependent lung will increase
  approximately 10% when the patient is turned to the
  lateral position ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx44wc0pknevgr86khwmx4dx))
- Although the ventilation will not
  change significantly once the nondependent hemithorax
  is open, the FRC of this nondependent lung will tend to
  increase approximately 10% ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx44z02ygsv1kjrexp4vsdk7))
- When the chest is open, due to disruption of the chest
  wall, both lungs tend to collapse to a minimal lung vol-
  ume if expiration is prolonged. Thus the end-expiratory
  volume of each lung is directly a function of the time
  allowed for expiration. The compliance of the entire
  respiratory system increases significantly once the non-
  dependent hemithorax is open. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx44y0wgmk8cx2q9e0qtzt0m))
- The
  respiratory systems of mammals do not function adequately
  with an open hemithorax due to two physiologic problems.
  First, paradoxical ventilation (also called “pendelluft”) in
  which gas moves into the open-chest lung from the intact
  lung during expiration and then reverses flow during inspi-
  ration. This leads to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. And
  second, due to the swinging motion of the mediastinum
  between the hemithoraces during the respiratory cycle,
  which interferes with cardiac preload and causes hemody-
  namic instability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4585cg54k20xenhwemkjps))
- Because of the fall in FRC and compliance of the
  dependent lung in the lateral position, application of
  PEEP selectively to this lung only (using a DLT and two
  anesthetic circuits), will improve gas exchange.132 This
  is different than the effect of nonselectively applying
  PEEP to both lungs in the lateral position where PEEP
  tends to preferentially distribute to the most compliant
  lung regions and will tend to hyperinflate the nonde-
  pendent lung without causing any improvement in gas
  exchange ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx450qsqrw8yegkzd9te3ehx))
- Atelectasis will develop in an average of 6% of the lung
  parenchyma after induction of anesthesia in the supine
  position. This atelectasis will be evenly distributed in the
  dependent portions of both lungs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx451rqsv80vfdshdg2qm01p))
- Turning the patient to
  the lateral position, there will be a slight decrease of total
  atelectasis to 5% of lung volume but this will now be con-
  centrated totally in the dependent lung. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4522ghfk6naj5t88mvk6dd))
- Gravity has some effect on distribution of pul-
  monary blood flow. In the lateral position, the blood flow
  to the dependent lung is generally thought to be increased
  by 10% compared to the same lung in the supine posi-
  tion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx454qx576zjfspc0pyrdd99))
- Pulmonary arteriovenous
  shunt during general anesthesia will usually increase from
  approximately 5% in the supine position to 10% to 15% in
  the lateral position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx4557y5m7xaqg914371q5t8))
