## Highlights
- Immediately after the abrupt loss of effective blood flow, the hypotension-induced baroreflex withdrawal with the net increase in the vascular resistance maintains an impaired antegrade and pulmonary blood flow ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5j14pr02m3jdz39mtyz77v6))
- When arterial and systemic venous pressures reach equilibrium, the mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf) is approximately 6–12 mmHg ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5j16f6aq4b9b8tv19tzmzaj))
- At the same time, cerebral perfusion decreases while the damage of fatty acids of the neuronal cell membrane by reactive oxygen species leads to a progressive increase in membrane permeability and severe derangements of intracellular electrolytes, resulting in cell swelling and brain edema formation [[10](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10741-019-09772-7#ref-CR10)]. This, together with venous congestion, increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and damages the neuropil and synaptic structures and/or contacts.

- even during optimal CPR, the cardiac output is between 25 and 40% of pre-arrest values while the coronary arteries receive 5–15% of this amount ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5j19j51a90dqrh0szzds3dp))
