## Highlights
- A cautious approach should be taken if administering premedication in
  patients with pulmonary hypertension/​RV dysfunction, or severe AS ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvnrb1gts15xtwy9yngm3spv))
- CPB causes platelet dysfunction, haemolysis and consumption of
  coagulation factors. This is minimal for the first 2h but increases with
  prolonged duration. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvnrgfat4dvr8ed91sgxq0g3))
- The most widely used cardioplegic solution consists of crystalloid mixed
  with blood and can be administered warm or cold. The crystalloid
  contains high concentrations of K+ which precipitates the arrest of the
  heart in diastole. Glutamate and aspartate may be added to promote
  oxidative phosphorylation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvnrhhe3ek1gyf8vwfe742td))
- Protamine can cause systemic hypotension and pulmonary hypertension
  and should be administered slowly to minimise these effects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvnrvg3n6c1jaqd5yak0ppxc))
- The lateral decubitus position, with the operating table ‘broken’ to
  separate the ribs, is used for the majority of procedures. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx3y3bqkkfpgzb8ptkmxpkyt))
- Postoperative mechanical ventilation stresses pulmonary suture lines
  and increases air leaks and risk of chest infection; avoid, if possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx3y3zzs9sb8mg4y92txv1rn))
- Predicted postoperative (ppo) value of the PFT results is calculated by
  the following formula: ppo = preoperative value × (19 –​ number of
  segments resected)/​19. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx3y8d4kaw15hj196aeyqfrq))
- If preoperative DLCO or ppoFEV1
  is <40% predicted normal, the
  patient should undergo CPET prior to surgery ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx3y9erhkb3bt78wdb94kwsx))
- CPET assesses VO2
  max which is used to inform the risk of
  perioperative morbidity and mortality. Patients with a VO2max 10–​
  15mL/​kg/​min are higher risk and should have postoperative HDU
  admission. VO2
  max <10mL/​kg/​min are very high risk and surgery
  may not be appropriate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx3y9xp8ryg5436sam7pwrkk))
- Smoking cessation and reducing alcohol consumption 4w preoperatively
  reduces pulmonary complications and risk of death ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx3yg9w2kbnk0kan06zjfsmx))
- Most volatiles weakly inhibit hypoxic pulmonary
  vasoconstriction, but with little impact at ≤1 MAC ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx3ym0hbtsxwdbm6qxtm80z2))
- PONV should be avoided ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx3yma3s6tgpfs8ce4r3syx2))
- Sizes of plastic DLTs are given in Charrière (Ch) gauge (equivalent to
  French gauge), which is the external circumference of the tube in mm.
  Thus, a 39Ch tube has an external diameter of about 13mm ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx40r1hxnmx74ezbyx4524pw))
- Advance the tube to around 29cm, which is the average depth for
  patients who are 170–​180cm tall. There is a 1cm change in depth for
  every 10cm variation in the patient’s height from this position ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx40wsrqgq9bd3wnqz3n95pn))
- Increase FiO2 to 0.5–​1.0 before initiating OLV. Note the airway pressure
  (Paw
  ) generated by this VT
  . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx41ercnbe2mxszbs4m4xerh))
