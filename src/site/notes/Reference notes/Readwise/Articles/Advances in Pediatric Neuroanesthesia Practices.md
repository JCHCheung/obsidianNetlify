- Summary: Advances in pediatric neuroanesthesia practices involve evolving techniques in pediatric neurosurgery, such as minimally invasive procedures. These innovations show potential benefits like lower complication rates and shorter hospital stays. However, further data is needed to fully understand the long-term outcomes in pediatric patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures.

## Highlights
- Although it is known that cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases from age 7 months and peaks at 6 years, the lower limits of cerebral autoregulation in children and especially neonates are unclear ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0dh7nw35se4gwdzkvy4ctd7))
- Cerebral autoregulation appears to be intact at birth in healthy patients ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0dh87hp91cx6jg956vgsg6j))
- Neonates and infants are at highest risk than any other age group for morbidity and mortality during the perioperative period due to respiratory and cardiac-related events ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0dhd1r8rpt2ztzj88gjmv9h))
- Pediatric neurosurgical patients have increased incidence of mortality and lower academic achievement in adolescence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0dhd994jp0n9xedzqfwa2n8))
- Although induced hypotension and acute normovolemic hemodilution has been proposed as adjuvants for blood sparing protocol, both places the patients at risk for hypovolemia resulting in hemodynamic instability and compromised end-organ perfusion.

- Tranexamic acid is a synthetic derivative of lysine that blocks the lysine binding sites of plasminogen molecules, inhibiting the interaction of plasminogen with plasmin and fibrin ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0dhr3ztz17bavdbn0m99n8y))
- Tranexamic acid has been associated with thrombotic events [[62](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521689624000247#bib62)] and postoperative seizures ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0dhs5jmscpa1t5rk85cyg30))
- Given the distribution of superficial nerves in posterior cranial surgery, these are considered more painful procedures for children ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0dhve5bngqk99fhq4k2xz4y))
