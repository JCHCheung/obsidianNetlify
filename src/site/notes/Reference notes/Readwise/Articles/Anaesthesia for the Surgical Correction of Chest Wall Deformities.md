## Highlights
- PE is defined as the posterior incursion of the [sternum](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/sternum) and of the adjacent costal cartilages ([Fig 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2058534920300615#fig1)). In contrast, PC is characterised by the protrusion of the anterior chest wall ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx46sg1rp65hs4a22769syth))
- An objective measure routinely used to gauge the severity of PE is the Haller index ([Fig 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2058534920300615#fig4)). This is obtained from [CT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/computed-tomography) imaging by dividing the lateral diameter by the anteroposterior diameter. The condition is considered significant when Haller index is >3.25 (normal value 2.56). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx46vhmtz4th6c3d512vns3k))
- [Mitral valve prolapse](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mitral-valve-prolapse) with [mitral regurgitation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mitral-insufficiency) is seen in 18â€“45% of patients with PE because of mechanical distortion of the [mitral annulus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mitral-annulus) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx473xersbhh3gxfwa4sfhqp))
- The [brachial plexus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/brachial-plexus) is at particular risk when the arms are abducted during a Nuss repair. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx47aynhn7dnjwqc8yy42j7z))
- The major potential intraoperative complications the anaesthetist needs to be aware of are cardiac, vascular or liver injury or perforation leading to life-threatening haemorrhage. Bar slippage and misplacement can also cause trauma, cardiac compression or right [ventricular outflow tract obstruction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gx47c2r0qh278xx92asn95ac))
