## Highlights
- In the presence of (+) charged large asymmetric proteins, ⬆️ neutralization and RBC aggregation causes ⬆️ ESR ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48db0dkpcgmds84z0j3b6ws))
- In the 1900s, based on differences in ESR between pregnant and non-pregnant women, it was used as a test of pregnancy. This was due to physiological increase of fibrinogen production in pregnancy. 
  Other proteins like Immunoglobulins also ⬆️ ESR ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48datg1g3kr06wgzwqgtx02))
- In Anemia, ⬇️ RBC count ⬇️ (-) charges and thus ⬆️ESR. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48dbaw2ndn41vpn934xp066))
- While both Fibrinogen(Acute phase reactant) and Ig are ⬆️ in inflammation, they have a long t 1/2 (100 hr for Fib; 14 days for IgG). 
  Thus ESR remains elevated for days to weeks after resolution of inflammation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48dbnavyrtbm7sendq2k6rb))

- CRP was discovered when precipitation was observed in the plasma of patients with Pneumococcal PNA which decreased as patients recovered. They later uncovered that some protein had reacted with the C-polysaccharide of Pneumococcus and christened it C Reactive Protein ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48de69fbemwj23p5rqezhbx))
- CRP is a Pattern Recognition Protein(PRR) synthesised by the liver in response to inflammation and is mediated by IL-1,IL-6 and TNF. CRP has a low t1/2 (~6h) and falls quickly once inflammation resolves and synthesis stops ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48dexwz199pqakctw595agy))

- ESR-CRP discordance can happen because of many reasons. 
  a) in cases of recently resolved inflammations, ESR may still be ⬆️ due to ⬆️t1/2. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48dknntctwgyb43an3dxstm))

- IG4 Dz & Myeloma - ⬆️ globulins may ⬆️ ⬆️ESR while CRP is normal/mildly ⬆️ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48dp2wnmfhfsknqqr1khdbf))
- In HLH, ESR ⬇️⬇️ 2/2 hypofibrinogenemia but CRP ⬆️⬆️⬆️ ! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48dra93kntxc6zfx0dmz7nk))
- DIC is an important cause of markedly elevated CRP with an ESR that’s very low.
  It’s a highly inflammatory state but the fibrinogen which usually raises ESR is absent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48drn5b51zcf4rd7ynxrv9w))
- ESR goes super high after IVIG treatment - so can’t use to measure response in things like Kawasaki or MIS-C (or any other inflammatory disorder Rx with IVIG) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48dsb0j70p41hm8taq7gct5))
