## Highlights
- Preloading with i.v. crystalloid fluids before spinal anaesthesia has been found to be largely ineffective in reducing hypotension ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9qz9ecxasc6pjsfssymw9d))
- There is good evidence that [ephedrine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ephedrine), which is predominantly a β-adrenergic agonist, causes fetal [acidosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acidosis) when used to prevent or treat hypotension. It crosses the [placenta](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/placenta) and has direct [sympathomimetic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/sympathomimetic-drug) effects in the fetus.[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2058534920301050#bib6) This leads to a degree of [acidaemia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/organic-acidemia), although the incidence of defined fetal acidosis (umbilical artery pH<7.2) is not changed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9r1n3jdsyg3101wfzsf521))
- Alpha-adrenergic agonists are therefore preferred. These have a variable amount of accompanying β-activity. [Phenylephrine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/phenylephrine), a pure α-agonist, is the standard choice because of the amount of supporting data available, including studies to assess optimal [dosage regimens](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/drug-dose-regimen) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs9r39bq95vj4p5yqshf0kn0))
- Phenylephrine has the same advantages over ephedrine in women with pre-eclampsia. The dose requirement is lower, and therefore the starting [infusion rate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/infusion-rate) should be reduced. The aim should be to avoid a rapid decrease in arterial pressure that may reduce uteroplacental blood flow to an already-compromised fetus.
