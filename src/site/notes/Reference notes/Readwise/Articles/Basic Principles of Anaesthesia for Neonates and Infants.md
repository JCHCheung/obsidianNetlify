## Highlights
- The diaphragm is flatter
  and less domed than the adult with limited and
  less efficient movement. It also contains a lower
  percentage of fatigue-resistant type-I muscle
  fibres ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjn9gesd3q8b5sabgp9bf1z))
- Tidal volume is relatively fixed and
  increasing respiratory rate (not tidal volume)
  increases alveolar minute ventilation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjn9zvaf8wcfbx00jk0xfts))
- Chest
  wall compliance is high and the total compli-
  ance of the chest approximates to that of the
  lungs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjna9kqf9fbrfam6m8swyk4))
- The lungs are relatively stiff at birth, but
  compliance increases dramatically over the first
  few hours as residual lung fluid is removed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjnaj2qse8phz4kstxztwdk))
- During early fetal life, the bronchial tree grows
  by a process of dichomatous branching to pro-
  duce 16–25 generations that will form the
  future airways. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjn35tamc2yw8jkzbpakgxn))
- Structures then develop, by a
  process of branching and budding, to form res-
  piratory bronchioles by 24 weeks’gestation and
  extra-uterine survival of the fetus is possible at
  this stage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjn2vxw23b7gx28y7rvj0j5))
- Functional residual capacity (FRC) is low in
  the neonate due to the elastic recoil of the lungs
  drawing in the compliant chest wall during
  expiration. Closing volume is high and often
  encroaches on FRC, a situation seen during
  anaesthesia. This results in airway closure dur-
  ing ventilation leading to intrapulmonary shunt-
  ing and a reduction in oxygen tension. This
  effect can be reversed with the use of continu-
  ous positive end-expiratory pressure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjnc22gvqmjf6wrzm6rsjmk))
- Lamellar bodies, which contain
  mature components of the surfactant system,
  increase in number and achieve a critical mass
  at 30–32 weeks’ gestation, thereby increasing
  surfactant production. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjn3nthnm264av6fcdvcjrp))
- Oxygen
  consumption is relatively high in the newborn
  (6–8 ml kg–1 min–1), approximately twice that
  of adult levels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjncwy0g27x3bwsm7b20jek))
- As the ratio of alveolar ventila-
  tion to FRC is high in early life (5:1 compared
  with 1.5:1 in older children and adults), FRC is
  a less efficient buffer to changes in the partial
  pressures of the inspired gas mixture, these
  changes being more rapidly reflected in alveo-
  lar and arterial pressures. One result of this is
  that hypoxaemia develops rapidly when venti-
  lation is interrupted ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjnjkz20j2pczd0bd83gd8k))
- At birth, the lung contains relatively few
  alveoli (10% of adult). The region for gas
  exchange is made up of a few generations of
  wide and smooth walled transitory ducts that
  open into saccules with rounded contours.
  Alveolar growth accelerates following birth and
  continues until 8 years of age ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjn4rs86pjsfga7x36nfqm0))
- The combination of a high
  work of breathing, increased oxygen consump-
  tion, high alveolar ventilation compared with
  FRC, higher closing volume and susceptibility
  to diaphragmatic muscle fatigue indicates that
  anaesthesia in the very young is best achieved
  with a technique based on intubation and con-
  trolled ventilation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjnmpxfnvznhdd95qp72q9a))
- In the newborn and during infancy, the ribs
  extend horizontally from the vertebral column
  and their configuration is circular, similar to
  the position of deep inspiration in adults. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjn96e8xd61mrn0dvckah3h))
- Infants have a large head and a short neck, the neck muscles
  being insufficiently developed to maintain the head in position
  without support ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjnnwr1h05xdqx093b4gbv8))
- Neonates and infants are obligatory nasal
  breathers, so that any obstruction of the nasal passages can
  significantly increase the work of breathing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjnp46gzdqc7vr9wgt9c526))
- Sarcomeres comprise about 60% of
  the adult myocardium compared with only 30% in the newborn.
  This results in a neonatal myocardium that is less compliant
  with a fixed stroke volume. Thus, cardiac output is rate depen-
  dant with normal heart rates of 130–160 beats min–1 at birth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjpn5x10c9kh0sy689q4ya1))
- A large tongue in
  relation to the oropharynx increases the likelihood of airway
  obstruction and difficulties with laryngoscopy during anaes-
  thesia ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjnpda90vcv4xjh5ktnbs32))
- Sympathetic innervation of the myocardium is incomplete
  at birth and parasympathetic tone predominates. Bradycardia
  is easily induced by hypoxaemia and manoeuvres that
  increase vagal tone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjpp5y13tyz4xkqv4phsmp5))
- The larynx is at a higher level (C3/4) compared with
  the adult airway; the narrowest part is at the level of the
  cricoid ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjnq22yqdfzxq2e77avyjfg))
- Vagal stimulation initially leads to a
  reduction in ventricular output with only small changes in
  heart rate. However, when bradycardia develops, profound
  decreases in cardiac output occur. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjpp8mhj43x5j35z0j3ssfh))
- The epiglottis is long, U-shaped and angled at 45°.
  Straight blade laryngoscopes are more useful for intubation in
  neonates and infants as the tip of the blade can be used to lift
  the long and floppy epiglottis to expose the larynx. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjnr9qe784ezf7qk2z4qrs1))
- In the
  newborn, the length of the trachea is only 5 cm and the tip of
  an endotracheal tube may easily be displaced into a bronchus
  during intubation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjnsww2dcdwfx18cj8p3c0y))
- During anaesthesia, systolic arterial pressure offers an
  excellent guide to the blood volume status in neonates and
  infants; hypotension usually indicates hypovolaemia. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjpqy95sgf65fwp5jdpe6wc))
- Infants born prematurely are prone to develop apnoea follow-
  ing anaesthesia and surgery, with an incidence of 20–30% in
  otherwise healthy preterm infants undergoing inguinal hernia
  repair. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjpfk5bd4qpwf24fbcmy14n))
- Fluid
  requirements in term and preterm infants are high, reflecting
  high metabolic demands. However, requirements decrease
  during infancy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjprbce1f4dyz9bk24v6kha))
- Apnoeic episodes can occur up to a postconceptual age
  (PCA) of 60 weeks (PCA = gestational age at birth + postna-
  tal age). However, the peak incidence occurs in infants
  younger than a PCA of 44 weeks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjpg1q77cmmcrs5y1shqfnj))
- in term and preterm babies, maintenance fluid
  should contain 5% glucose as these children have less carbo-
  hydrate reserve and ability to prevent hypoglycaemia. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjpt9hpg4bq6jhbxanbxmdn))
- Before birth, the combined ventricular output of the fetal heart
  is high (500 ml kg–1 min–1) and the left ventricle contributes
  only one-third to this combined output. After birth, the output
  from the left and right ventricles is the same (300–400
  ml kg–1 min–1). Therefore, the output of the left ventricle
  increases by > 200% and determinants of myocardial perfor-
  mance are close to maximum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjpjyq3w4cyq9zmtyc36fwp))
- Over the next few months, car-
  diac output decreases to 150–200 ml kg–1 min–1, suggesting
  that the heart acquires a greater functional reserve with matu-
  ration. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjpm4gnya8a43jzt048q0ak))
- Ventricular thickness equilibrates at 3–6 months and
  then becomes greater on the left ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjpmc8e8ftwp34zxtqr3tvc))
- Being unable to shiver, the neonate
  produces heat by non-shivering thermogenesis. This involves
  the oxidation of triglycerides located in brown fat stores. This
  heat production requires an increase in basal metabolic rate
  and oxygen consumption that may worsen any pre-existing
  hypoxaemia. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjqeg1xs4e3x8gvxapagswd))
- The brain of a neonate weighs 350 g (25% of adult weight) and
  grows rapidly, doubling in size by 6 months. At birth, approxi-
  mately 25% of neuronal cells are present and cellular develop-
  ment of the cortex and brain stem is complete at one year ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjpz0n70861bqgw20ps3c72))
- The range of temperatures over which heat pro-
  duction is kept to a minimum is known as the neutral thermal
  environment. During anaesthesia, babies can be kept warm by
  heating the operating theatre to 25–27°C before the child
  arrives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjqdfqctd7h3qpyv92r1khs))
- The
  central nervous system begins to show signs of myelination
  prior to birth and this process continues into the third year of life.
  Myelination begins in the peripheral nervous system and the
  motor nerves myelinate before the sensory nerves. Incomplete
  myelination does not imply lack of function but merely a slow-
  er conduction time. This is offset by a shorter interneuron dis-
  tance for the impulse to travel. There is now overwhelming evi-
  dence indicating that the neurophysiological components
  required for pain perception are present by mid-gestation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjq0xez0wbzm7ht9exh4p0x))
- CBF is constant over a wide range of mean arterial pres-
  sures, i.e. 50–150 mmHg. However, the range over which CBF
  remains constant in the very young has not been determined ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjq2effdbjwgkg76xvq8b2y))
- In general, uptake and dis-
  tribution of drugs are increased or unchanged while elimination
  is reduced, leading to an increased risk of overdose and toxicity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjqf50x6kz2mfzr33ktasgm))
- Increased cardiac output in the neonate leads to a faster circula-
  tion time and, therefore, faster distribution of drugs to their site
  of action ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjqfkmd7mradefa6bryg3vp))
- A large percentage of a neonate’s body water is con-
  tained in the ECF compartment (Table 1). This large ECF vol-
  ume influences the volume of distribution of many drugs, espe-
  cially those which are highly ionised, e.g. muscle relaxants. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjqgcg8e4h8t6awz5ygfdf0))
- Increases in protein binding and protein concentration occur
  with age and concentrations of α1-acid glycoprotein are signifi-
  cantly lower in newborns than in adults. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjqgqyg7y7ynygsdkhgzdmn))
- The occurrence of IVH during
  anaesthesia should largely be preventable. Abrupt fluctuations in
  cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and cerebral venous
  pressure play a role in the development of IVH and values
  should be maintained at normal levels during anaesthesia.
  Therefore, arterial and venous pressures should remain constant
  and rapid fluid administration, hypoxaemia and hypercarbia
  should be avoided. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjq50bqnmcwmn759m5gswtn))
- Hepatic enzymes involved with drug metabo-
  lism mature at different times. There is decreased activity and
  concentration of the microsomal enzymes responsible for phase
  I (non-synthetic) reactions involved in the metabolism of syn-
  thetic opioids. The activity of this system reaches adult levels
  within a few days of birth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjqnwrq8ykryyqpm994w712))
- (phase II, synthetic reactions), for example with glucuronide,
  is also reduced and does not approach adult levels until 6
  months of age. This effects the elimination of morphine and
  doses should be reduced accordingly ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjqpptqj24jh13ffe672w33))
- Renal function, both
  glomerular and tubular, is reduced in the newborn thereby
  affecting drug excretion. Proximal tubular secretion is impor-
  tant in the elimination of conjugated drugs and reaches adult
  values by 7 months of age. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjqqjhyas8wke7zv2xxsb6d))
- The potency of an inhaled anaesthetic is determined by its
  minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). MAC is lower in
  preterm infants than in term infants and increases with PCA.
  MAC generally increases to a maximum level by 6 months of
  age in a term infant and, thereafter, decreases with increasing
  age ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvjqs8drt5gwvcxxmm66c7w4))
- There is substantial evidence to suggest that the neuromuscu-
  lar junction in neonates is 3 times more sensitive to non-depo-
  larising muscle relaxants than that of adults. However, this
  sensitivity is balanced by an almost identical increase in the
  volume of distribution (because of a large ECF) so that the
  required dose is unaffected. However, as a result of the
  pronged elimination time, doses of additional relaxants should
  be reduced and given less frequently. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvk4rksans615gn39t2g5ca9))
- Sevoflurane is somewhat unusual in that there does not
  appear to be an age related difference in MAC during early
  infancy. After 6 months, an abrupt step down in MAC has
  been observed with sevoflurane, following which it remains
  constant during childhood ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvk4frxaja8s2b7myk4a5b7y))
- The recommended dose
  of succinylcholine is twice that of adults (approximately 2
  mg kg–1). Its duration of action, terminated via the action of
  plasma cholinesterase, is 5–8 min. The rate of succinylcholine
  hydrolysis may be slower in the preterm infant (immature
  liver) than in older child. Due to the activity of succinyl-
  choline at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, significant
  side-effects may occur. For example, the action of succinyl-
  choline on the sino-atrial node in neonates and infants may
  produce severe bradycardia and asystole. This can be attenu-
  ated by the prior administration of atropine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvk4thjejjv9cc9vep9p0ymr))
- There is an increased sensitivity to barbiturates and opioids in
  the neonate and they also have prolonged effects. This has
  been attributed to the immaturity of the blood-brain barrier,
  allowing faster penetration and rise in concentration of these
  drugs in the brain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvk4q8a0h6b94hptfxv744jm))
