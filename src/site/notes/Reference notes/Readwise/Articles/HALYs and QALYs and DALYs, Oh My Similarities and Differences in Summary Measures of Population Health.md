## Highlights
- Utility can be understood as the value, or preference, that people have for health outcomes along a continuum anchored with death (0) and perfect health (1.0) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gycx3gbg25tvqm0bvkc3y7gh))
- The original formulation of QALYs was drawn from the theoretical underpinnings of welfare economics and expected utility theory ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gycx3p9j4dc34ah12zsqyy5h))
- Quality-adjusted life years are often seen as inexorably linked with utilitarianism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gycx3tww4ajee6v39n3qq8ge))
- Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were developed to quantify the burden of disease and disability in populations, as well as to set priorities for resource allocation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gycx62z6780jh717xpd2bsdb))
- There are three general steps in calculating a HALY: (a) describing health, i.e., as a health state or as a disease/condition; (b) developing values or weights for the health state or condition, which are called HRQL weights here; and (c) combining values for different health states or conditions with estimates of life expectancy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gycxbkfenr7jfkq1ys9rt62x))
- In contrast to QALY methods, DALY architects chose to attach estimates of HRQL to specific diseases, rather than to health states ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gycxq5q7r1ep7k46hda3ygbx))
- Disability states in DALYs do not take account of comorbid conditions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gycyyr9y9zcwbxkzd0qpmcnj))
- A therapy that creates unwanted side effects cannot be captured within the DALY framework ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gycyye3r63tafpt1rbm02snr))
