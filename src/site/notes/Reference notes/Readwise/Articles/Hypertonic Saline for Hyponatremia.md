## Highlights
- This misconception originated from a [1979 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/111645/) comparing peripheral venous infusions of amino acids for parenteral nutrition to nonnitrogen solutions (e.g., 5% dextrose in 0.9% saline). Amino acid solutions with osmolarity  >600 mOsm/L infused for 35.2±19.9 hours had twice the risk for phlebitis associated with nonnitrogen solutions.   These findings were conflated to apply to 3% saline (osmolarity 1027 mOsm/L) which was not studied ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpxfmaneqapbqf5dew5q6ge0))
