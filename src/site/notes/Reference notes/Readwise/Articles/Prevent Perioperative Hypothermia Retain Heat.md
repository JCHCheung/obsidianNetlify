## Highlights
- Heat loss is proportional to the temperature difference by a power of 4 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsexp26w0wqkjfcm9h6v64by))
- Convection is the direct transfer of heat to moving currents of air or water surrounding the body. It’s proportional to air velocity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsexpag07crp63rcs2m3kgnb))
- Infants and young children are much more likely to get hypothermic in a cold environment because of significantly higher surface to volume ratio (toddlers 2X and infant 3X the adult ratio) and little muscle mass or fat insulation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsexrnb8myets7er17sqr5wv))
- Cover the head. About 7-10% of heat loss occurs through the exposed head. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsextprsrz9sjpbnb5qqqtg1))
- Perioperative hypothermia is defined as a core body temperature below 36°C (96.8°F) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsd9pecv6svqkzjvbqpn5t7c))
- Perioperative hypothermia can cause:
  • cardiovascular complications
  • delayed wound healing
  • altered states of consciousness
  • increased infection rate
  • increased blood loss
  • prolongation of drug effect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsd9prkqqrz47aqqyjxy40tb))
- Anesthesia disrupts normal thermoregulation by:
  • changing the brain’s thermal regulatory set points
  • decreasing metabolic rate,
  • altering the distribution of blood flow ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsd9qrw7n0pa64xmcw1nbje5))
- Sinking below the lower threshold triggers vasoconstriction and shivering to retain heat and to increase heat production.
  Anesthesia resets those thresholds by 2-3°C, making perioperative hypothermia more likely. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsd9sqey0trdc6en54ne8cn9))
- Intraoperative vasodilation is caused by both:
  • the direct effect of anesthetic agents
  • the indirect consequences of a lowered vasoconstriction threshold. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsd9vm00xg8cx04av2qrnnp0))
- As the hypovolemic patient rewarms, the patient will vasodilate, potentially causing hypotension.
  In a severely hypothermic patient, such as from cold water emersion, rapid rewarming can precipitate cardiovascular collapse and possible cardiac arrest for the same reason. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsd9ychg32vtf1hn0gxh5rgh))
