## Highlights
- Pharmacologic interventions during CPR are restrained by (1) impaired
  distribution of drugs or their metabolites such that they are incapable of
  acting on their targets and (2) changes in the pharmacologic actions of the
  drugs by acidosis, hypercarbia, hypoxemia, down regulation of receptors,
  and altered organ function ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5hv5bhjb99af5st3j4vpwqh))

  ing CPR, adrenergic agents with predominant a, effect have been shown
  to be more effective as vasoconstrictor drugs, presumably because
  extrajunctional a,-receptors are more accessible to circulating catechola-
  mines than postjunctional a,-receptors. This may explain why adrener-
  gic amines that have predominant a, actions such as methoxamine
  (Vasoxyl) and phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine) are less effective than
  epinephrine after prolonged cardiac arrest. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5hvb3vdbyxyxzgc9w7adjss))
