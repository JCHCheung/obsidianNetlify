## Highlights
- As oral paracetamol is 80–90% absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, it is nearly as effective as the i.v. formulation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5phhxdw5jcfybm2kdswkgw))
- Oral paracetamol displays peak plasma concentration within 30–60 min ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5phvn8sm4j0yxjv96gtr04))
- i.v. paracetamol instantaneously with onset of pain relief after 5–10 min ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5pj0hppvjfpewj5376v40r))
- studies indicate synergistic effects on opioid reduction when paracetamol and NSAIDs are prescribed together. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5pknr82b3bn6jb85ced7mv))
- Whereas [dexamethasone](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dexamethasone) is mostly recognized as an [antiemetic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/antiemetic), a larger dose of more than 0.1 mg kg−1 has been reported to display intrinsic analgesic effects without an associated risk for [postoperative wound infections](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/surgical-infection). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5pr9zcvrk2w4q5qxnzdqk4))
- An off-label use of dexamethasone has shown that its addition to local anaesthetic prolongs the duration of [brachial plexus blocks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/brachial-plexus-block), theoretically by inhibiting potassium channel-mediated discharge of nociceptive C-fibres ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5q9xncmx5b6hpexf596bk4))
