- Summary: An anatomical landmark-guided technique for the external oblique intercostal plane block offers a simple approach for pain management during abdominal surgeries. This method targets specific nerves to provide effective analgesia in the upper abdominal region. Further studies are needed to confirm its safety and efficacy compared to ultrasound-guided techniques.

## Highlights
- The sixth rib can be located by two distinct palpatory methods. In the craniocaudal technique, the second rib is identified just below the clavicle, and subsequent counting facilitates localisation of the sixth rib. Alternatively, in the caudocephalad method, palpation and counting begin with the lower costal margin at the anterior axillary line, corresponding to the 10th rib ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0haex6dabrszndkabzdfwyq))
