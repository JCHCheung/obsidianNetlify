## Highlights
- The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines NeP as 'pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system'. It is divided into central or peripheral NeP according to the site of the lesion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3hs4dn05dc0y1am2q5a47tt))
- NeP is now regarded as a distinct clinical condition; patients present with similar hallmark characteristics: [allodynia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/allodynia), [hyperalgesia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hyperpathia), and [dysaesthesia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dysesthesia) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3hs6xgbt4hz3prr4v83h1y4))
- Choice of [amitriptyline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/amitriptyline), [duloxetine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/duloxetine), [gabapentin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gabapentin), or [pregabalin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pregabalin) as initial treatment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3hsdjvdnb64470jagwdwm8q))
    - Note: 1st line
- Sustained-release [oxycodone](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/oxycodone) and morphine are the opioids most studied. Long-term use may be associated with abuse, [cognitive impairment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cognitive-defect), and endocrine and immunological changes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3hsh8fv4pvcz9bj67q81aaw))
- The [tertiary amine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/tertiary-amine) TCAs (amitriptyline, [imipramine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/imipramine), clomipramine) are not recommended at doses greater than 75 mg day−1 in >65 yr because of major [anticholinergic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/parasympatholytic) and sedative adverse effects, and an increased risk of [sudden cardiac death](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/sudden-cardiac-death) at doses >100 mg day−1 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3hsh0a7hyh01y72mant7jt4))
- The onset of therapeutic effects of antidepressants is delayed. Hence their action is thought to be via long-term molecular and [neural plasticity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neural-plasticity), recruiting downstream mechanisms such as chromatin regulation, gene expression, recruitment of [neurotrophins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neurotrophin), and stimulating [neurogenesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neurogenesis) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3hsnvw7yp822b9ccp6bykxf))
- The action of antidepressant drugs on [noradrenaline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/noradrenalin) is a crucial component in the treatment of NeP. There are two proposed mechanisms for this: recruitment of descending noradrenergic pathways and peripheral noradrenaline recruitment from sympathetic nerves in the [dorsal root](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dorsal-root) ganglia. They may also act indirectly on proinflammatory cytokines ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3hspcgw8xs1dnbqs52pca0a))
