## Highlights
- Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful and disabling disorder affecting one or more extremities with vasomotor changes (colour or temperature changes relating to vasoconstriction or dilation of blood vessels), sudomotor changes (oedema and/or sweating), inflammatory changes, trophic changes (changes in nails or skin) and motor changes (weakness, tremor, dystonia) in the affected extremity. CRPS can occur even after trivial injury or even in the absence of any injury. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h48dy7hpqz475g31egat6hkf))
