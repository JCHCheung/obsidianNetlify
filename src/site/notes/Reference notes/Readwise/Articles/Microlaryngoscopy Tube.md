## Highlights
- A microlaryngoscopy tube (also generally called **'MLT'**, although this is a registered trademark) is in essence a **pediatric-sized standard ETT with an adult length** or an **adult standard ETT with a pediatric-sized diameter** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcaxdtw5q23p7xmz3r6tasj))
- One thing to keep in mind when using ETTs of such small size in adults is the **relatively high resistance to gas flow** through these tubes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcaz4c1pz0gwv89kr3n2s5v))
