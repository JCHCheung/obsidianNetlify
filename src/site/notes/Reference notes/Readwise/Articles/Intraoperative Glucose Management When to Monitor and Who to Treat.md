## Highlights
- Although most guidelines recommend perioperative treatment at 10 mmol·L−1, only the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain & Ireland specifically discusses the intraoperative period and recommends that glucose levels up to 12 mmol·L−1 may be tolerated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq432dg5anghgqbqpva78pcc))
- At an HbA1c of ≤ 7%, there is a reduced risk of infectious complications such as pneumonia, wound infection, urinary tract infection, and sepsis in noncardiac surgery. An HbA1c > 8% has been linked to increasing postoperative wound complications in knee arthroplasty ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq433bw5cjpajw1s6akrs5q7))
- The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain & Ireland has recommended that elective surgery be delayed when the HbA1c is > 8.5% ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq433xtjet67m5jcsk1jmfhj))
