## Highlights
- Above the arcuate line, the transversalis [fascia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fascia) and the [aponeuroses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/aponeurosis) separate the [rectus abdominis muscle](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rectus-abdominis-muscle) from the [abdominal cavity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/abdominal-cavity). Caudal to the arcuate line, the rectus abdominis muscle is in direct contact with the transversalis fascia ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grh0k24ysjtzhgtv3tgjzryq))
- needle tip and injection should be placed between the rectus abdominis muscle and the double layer that constitutes the posterior aspect of the rectus sheath ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grh0prqhdh75z7239ecr7aft))
- Because the tendinous inscriptions of the muscles are not complete posteriorly,[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323509510000578#bib7), [8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323509510000578#bib8) some communication between compartments is possible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grh0senwzb16rg072k74ac5j))
- The extent to which the abdominal wall muscles underlie the lateral corner of the rectus abdominis muscle is variable. In some cases, there is no underlying muscle to separate the rectus from the abdominal cavity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grh1386eg9rb1xpqb9w24y3d))
