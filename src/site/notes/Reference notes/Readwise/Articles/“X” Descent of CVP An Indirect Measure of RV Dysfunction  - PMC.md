## Metadata

- Full Title: “X” Descent of CVP: An Indirect Measure of RV Dysfunction ? - PMC
- Category: #articles
- URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4152694/#!po=75.0000

## Highlights
- The X descent is due to downward movement of the lateral annulus of the tricuspid valve during RV contraction and atrial relaxation. It coincides with ST segment on electrocardiogram.
- X descent is determined by right atrial and right ventricular function, volume loading conditioning and pericardial forces.
