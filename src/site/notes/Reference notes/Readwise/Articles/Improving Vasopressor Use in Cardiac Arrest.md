## Highlights
- Treatment with adrenaline prior to defibrillation was strongly associated with delayed defibrillation (3 min versus 0 min ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5mxrz7msgxm245yh6qc2c2d))
- greater resilience to ischaemia of the heart relative to the brain ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5mxwat79a5b90x66cnz27gn))
- Current guidelines do not recommend intracardiac or endobronchial administration due to the risk of injury / misplacement (intracardiac) or variable / uncertain absorption (endobronchial) [[22](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-023-04301-3#ref-CR22), [23](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-023-04301-3#ref-CR23)]. If central venous access is already in place then it should be the preferred route for drug administration due to the short transit time of drugs injected to reach the central circulation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5my0d99sdj5jn3kztnc3rye))
- Subsequent studies have highlighted limitations of coronary perfusion pressure as a determinant of ROSC, in that it does not necessarily reflect coronary blood flow and as aortic diastolic pressures decline over time, results may have been confounded by resuscitation time bias ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvgjef3k50qk52d5yzzyyj0t))
