## Highlights
- Early afterdepolarizations are the hallmark of one type of *triggered automaticity*. A long previous cycle (the *pause*) increases the amplitude of the early hump. If an EAD reaches threshold, a premature ventricular complexe (PVC) will appear. If this process becomes regenerative, each afterdepolarization producing yet another threshold-attaining EAD, TdP is the result ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvx5m50qy7fn6j4tadt05t1z))
- The precise events during TdP almost certainly involve gross dispersion of repolarization across the myocardium, including the possibility of migrating macroreentry pathways ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvx5q5vq7tygzt1nyvtb6p6v))
