## Highlights
- Local anesthetics work by binding to the α subunit of the voltage-gated Na+ channels, thus preventing the generation and conduction of nerve impulses ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpykfdv5df6h0hrnw5qtryw))
- Cocaine, the archetypical ester, is the only naturally occurring LA. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpysrx4btc0kjhd7kjpa6cj))
- The introduction of the amide LA lidocaine in 1948 was transformative. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpytje06px32pqywaaw68aw))
- Ropivacaine and levobupivacaine are the only commercially available single-enantiomer (single-optical-isomer) LAs. Both are S(–)-enantiomers, avoiding the increased cardiac toxicity associated with racemic mixtures and the R(+)-isomers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpyvtb6h5695qcvk07h6p8x))
- The α-subunit, the site of ion conduction and LA binding, has four homologous domains, each with six α-helical membrane-spanning segments ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpz0rzmr5jkw2j83mte16v3))
- The external surface of the α-subunit is heavily glycosylated, which serves to orient the channel properly within the plasma membrane ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpz12x6jprx9cggjj5ad9vd))
- In contrast to local anesthetics, note that both scorpion toxins (ScTX) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) have binding sites on the external surface of the channel ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpz2tjdkdbrt5sg69qpbgy3))
- In clinical practice, LAs are typically described by their potency, duration of action, speed of onset, and tendency for differential sensory nerve block ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpzf3f819gz9cnjwg2ydcfn))
- Esters undergo rapid hydrolysis in blood, catalyzed by non-specific esterases ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpzvwf1a6a4phrbmvf45r7w))
- Procaine and benzocaine are metabolized to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), the species underlying anaphylaxis to these agents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpzwbk9yctrf2bqew1y0zc6))
- There is also contro-versy about transient neurologic symptoms and persistent sacral deficits after lidocaine spinal anesthesia. The reports and the controversy have persuaded many physicians to abandon lidocaine spinal anesthesia ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwq08x8ng7rbnm93tq0gzkmp))
