## Highlights
- the intercostobrachial nerve runs along the infe-
  rior aspect
  of the brachial
  plexus
  sheath in the
  infraclavicular-axillary fossa and is often blocked by anes-
  thetic spread following infraclavicular injection ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2xw5d71f2jteb8vws2805))
- There is evidence that tourniquet application may be tolerated
  better, which is attributed to local anesthetic spread to the
  intercostobrachial nerve ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d2sn0t50emzg0b9180tmnx))
    - Note: (infraclavicular)
- The brachial plexus runs in a line between the base of the
  interscalene groove and the axilla, and knowing this is help-
  ful when trying to mentally visualize the location of the bra-
  chial plexus. Note that the direction in which this line runs
  will differ depending on whether the arm is adducted or
  abducted ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3d30t1wchxa6qj6hryeteqv))
