## Highlights
- End-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) is defined by the line connecting the left upper corner of multiple pressure-volume (PV) loops under different LV loading conditions (preload and afterload). It provides the maximal LV pressure at any given LV volume, that is, ESPVR represents the LV systolic property ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78jnmzs595kwrskjs27t89v))
- The X-intercept of ESPVR is V0, that is, unstressed LV volume ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78jmmjaaqpv294d8sa7qsa1))
- The slope of ESPVR, end-systolic elastance (Ees), which has been also referred to as Emax based on the time-varying elastance model,[27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib27),[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib29) load-independently represents [LV contractility](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/heart-left-ventricle-contractility) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78jq4nrnv4hthjd1v00a50f))

- As the LV volume increases to a higher range, the LV pressure also rises more steeply. The [elastin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/elastin) fibers, myocytes, and [titin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/titin) molecules in a [sarcomere](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/sarcomere) play a role in the process of forming LV stiffness.[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib38), [39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib39), [40](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib40) At higher LV pressure and volume ranges, the [collagen fibers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/collagen-fiber) and titin are overstretched, resulting in further resistance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78k4n9jcbes28k1vg8cdjas))
- Effective arterial elastance (Ea) is a conceptual framework of total afterload imposed on LV, which integrates [arterial stiffness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/arterial-stiffness) and peripheral [arterial resistance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/artery-resistance), and is calculated by measuring the ratio of ventricular end-systolic pressure to stroke volume (Ea = ESP/SV) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78k5zy6jnc88ezgz4hs1ks7))
- The interaction between the LV and [aorta](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/aorta) known as ventricular-arterial coupling is essential in [cardiovascular function](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cardiovascular-physiology), and therefore, the ratio of Ea to ESPVR (Ea/Ees) obtained from the PV diagram is often used to elucidate mechanical efficiency and performance of the ventricular-arterial system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78k6p46h6d6kczdt11wt1bn))

- PE is residual mechanical energy stored in [myocardium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/myocardium) at end-systole, which is not released as external work, and is believed to be dissipated as heat during relaxation[15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib15) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78m518awvxvx4b9p15a6tqp))
- There is a linear correlation between PVA and myocardial oxygen consumption (Vo2) per beat.[14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib14),[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib22),[26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib26),[51](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib51), [52](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib52), [53](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib53), [54](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib54), [55](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib55) Because PVA has the dimensions of energy (1 mm Hg·mL = 1.33 × 10−4 J), the concept of PVA can provide a valuable framework to elucidate the LV mechanical efficiency ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78m68aeg3cjgqwx674pmb5w))
- The ratio of SW to PVA is known as LV EET.[57](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib57) EET represents the efficiency of mechanical energy transfer from the LV to the arterial system (EET = SW/PVA)[49](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib49) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78m6zs70yvgmcycvn6yce8q))
- In AMI, LV [contractility](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/muscle-contractility) is decreased, leading to a reduction in stroke volume and blood pressure. The PV loop shifts rightward (initially along the original EDPVR) due to increases in both LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. The global ischemia caused by severe [hypoxemia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypoxemia) or [multivessel coronary artery disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/coronary-artery-disease) results in generalized [hypokinesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hypokinesia) of myocardium. This is depicted in the PV diagram as a decrease in Ees with unchanged V0, resulting in a smaller stroke volume.[59](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib59) It is of note that ESPVR may fail to reflect LV [systolic dysfunction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/systolic-dysfunction) when LV [diastolic pressure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/diastolic-blood-pressure) is markedly elevated,[60](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551713620300131#bib60) because ESP is composed of resting diastolic pressure and developed pressure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78mcc8m50t7w4qbb9trwwgv))
- in regional ischemia, ESPVR shifts rightward parallel with similar or slightly decreased Ees when compared at a comparable [systolic pressure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/systolic-blood-pressure) range ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78mfd2kt4nbbfj2wqckmk0p))
- Qload can become maximum when Ea equals Ees (Ea/Ees = 1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78pbb01vrcxqj46zff39k9d))
- mechanical efficiency per beat is also maximized when Ea/Ees is close to 0.5 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78pd3237c9eqbgvbgd8q51z))
- both Qload and Qheart become close to being most efficient when Ea/Ees is between 0.5 and 1.0, which enables the heart to maximize EW for a given LV preload and minimize the cardiac oxygen consumption, simultaneously. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78p9805mmwfa2mksd6s2wyr))
- Changes in LV EDPVR during myocardial ischemia/infarction are not uniform, depending on the state of coronary flow (maintained or discontinued) and the extent of ischemia (global or regional), and therefore result in multiple forms of [pathophysiology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pathophysiology) and [hemodynamic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hemodynamic) consequences in association with changes in ESPVR ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78ph3f8mh30jfxn6ng5q8x9))
- The current understandings of changes in EDPVR in an acute or subacute phase are that (1) EDPVR shifts to the upper-left during hypoxemia (ie, global ischemia/hypoxemia with maintained coronary flow), (2) EDPVR shifts upward during effort angina or pacing-induced ischemia (ie, regional demand ischemia with coronary artery stenosis), and (3) EDPVR is unchanged or may shift to the lower-right when coronary blood flow is reduced (ie, regional supply ischemia with coronary artery occlusion) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h78qafm0kng2h44xxpbwcbgy))
