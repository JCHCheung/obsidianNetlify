## Highlights
- An older man comes to the ED with abrupt onset nausea, & diarrhea
  He is joined by her daughter whom he is visiting from abroad
  Testing is below
  The diagnosis is unclear
  Until his daughter got just as sick too

- ALT >1000 has a narrow differential diagnosis
  https://t.co/qiTLjFhvZe
  There's lots of tests you can order. 
  But most diagnoses are made in the H+P
  Like this one
  In fact, in this case, my attending said the diagnosis was obvious from the beginning
  Just not to me ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ebtapper/status/1664679310974648340))
- When I meet someone with ALT>1000, I think:
  1âƒ£Ischemic hepatitis. Right ðŸ«€failure? ðŸ«€-genic shock? Cool legs?
  2âƒ£Biliary ðŸª¨. Pain? imaging!
  3âƒ£Drug induced liver injury. Tylenol? Run every med through https://t.co/Vaa7EwCHmR
  4âƒ£Viral hep. Hep A/B/C
  But these werenâ€™t the answers ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ebtapper/status/1664679312350380038))
- The daughter getting sick, that was the clue
  Two people from the same house have acute liver injury
  Was it hep A? Good thought. But both were immune.
  Question: What exposure have they shared?
  Answer: Dad made omelets this morning ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ebtapper/status/1664679313633837064))
- Mushroom omelets
  Dad likes to take long walks and forage for his mushrooms.
  This is what he found

- Amanita Phalloides - Death Cap - mushroom poisoning
  1. Case-fatality rate of 10-20%
  2. Dose-dependent. 1 or 2 mushrooms can kill
  3. Phases: incubation (6-24h), GI (severe N/V/D;24-48h), liver injury
  4. The cause of death is liver failure

- A recent outbreak of amanita poisoning in California showed that death can be avoided with liver transplant. 
  In this case series, many people recovered without transplant. All patients received a smattering of treatments
  So how do we treat amanita poisoning?

- But first, we need to know how Amanita causes liver injury
  1. It's heat stable. Cant cook it dead
  2. Acid stable. Gut cant neutralize
  3. Water soluble. Amanita is full of toxins but only amatoxin is absorbed in the gut. It goes directly to the liver
  Also: it looks crazyðŸ‘‡

- When amatoxin reaches the liver, it binds OATPB13 and the hepatocyte brings it in
  Then it inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II and cell function ceases
  Massive liver cell necrosis ensues

- If - IF - there is a treatment, it acts by blocking gut absorption, liver cell uptake, or hepatocyte death
  Gastric lavage is often recommended but this is only if the ingestion is very recent
  After that...referral to a transplant center is all I am confident in ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ebtapper/status/1664679322924331008))
- This figure shows the survival rates by treatments attempted. 
  One of the most common is Benzylpenicillin (Penicillin G, Bp). No one knows for sure if it works or how but it possibly blocks amatoxin-polymerase interaction
  N-acetylcysteine is frequently given too. Why not?

- Liver cell uptake may be inhibited by silibinin
  1. It blocks amatoxin binding to OATPB13
  2. It prevented liver injury in a controlled trial in beagles
  3. Uncontrolled studies in people have been used to suggest benefit

- You might wonder what silibinin is
  It is an active ingredient from milk thistle!
  Many of the patients in this case series received it IV in a Phase 2 trial that closed without data (https://t.co/coDDCun7nM)
  There will be more on milk thistle in a forthcoming tweetorial

- So how did our patients do?
  Both recovered without the need for liver transplant. One was enrolled in a phase 2 trial, receiving IV Milk Thistle (Silibinin). 
  Along the way they taught us many things: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ebtapper/status/1664679328964018196))
- Summary
  1âƒ£Think amanita if acute liver injury with severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
  2âƒ£Mechanism of amanita liver injury: inhibition of RNA polymerase
  3âƒ£PenG, NAC, and Silibin are frequently given but robust evidence for use is limited ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ebtapper/status/1664679330163707905))
- I hope you enjoyed this #liverstory from long ago. I will return soon with a tweetorial on milk thistle. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ebtapper/status/1664679331254108180))
