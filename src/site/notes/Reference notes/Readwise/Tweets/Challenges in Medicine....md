  Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)
  A short 🧵#MedTwitter

- Intro:
  TMA syndromes are extraordinarily diverse❗️
  They may be
  -hereditary or acquired
  -occur in children and adults
  -onset can be sudden or gradual
  BUT
  despite their diversity, they are united by common, defining clinical and pathological features

- A short history of everything TMA

- Features:
  -Thrombopenia
  👉platelet aggregation & thrombi
  -microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA)
  👉RBC fragmentation (schistocytes)
  -end organ damage
  -LDH⬆️
  👉tissue ischemia & cell lysis
  -haptoglobin⬇️
  👉binds to free Hb, hemolysis
  -Coombs generally negative, PT/aPTT⬇️

- Pathology:
  -For all primary TMA syndromes the same
  - -renal arteriole occlusion with endotheliosis as well as lumen and vessel-wall fibrin
  - -Proliferation in the myocyte layer (“onion skinning”) may also be present

- Think first before you act:
  Before you start sophisticated lab tests and hypotheses, exclude common causes of MAHA and thrombocytopenia❗️
  Remember, any condition associated with DIC can occur with MAHA and thrombocytopenia
  👉rule out first

- Evaluate MAHA and thrombopenia:
  -severity of kidney injury as distinguishing feature
  -severe acute kidney injury
  👉consider complement-mediated (acquired/hereditary)
  -idiopathic disease in + 20%
  -TTP is also called ADAMTS13 deficiency–mediated TMA

- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura:
  -rare systemic form of TMA 
  👉severe deficiency in ADAMTS13
  👉disintegrin + metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif 13, which cleaves von Willebrand factor

- Complement-mediated aHUS:
  -0.4 cases per Mio per year
  -acquired or inherited defects in the alternative pathway
  -Extra-renal manifestations in 10-20%
  -AKI more prominent than in TTP
  -Genetic screening (CFH, CFI, C3, CFB, CD46, CFHR1) is essential, incl DGKE & MMACHC

- Shigatoxin-associated TMA:
  -most common form, mainly occurring in children <5 years
  -accounts for 90% of cases of HUS in children
  -transmission
  👉undercooked meat, unpasteurised dairy produce, direct contact, ingesting contaminated🥦🍅
  -majority is self-limiting

- Pregnancy-associated TMA:
  -Pregnancy + postpartum high-risk periods for TTP and complement-mediated aHUS❗️
  -typically in the 2nd + 3rd trimesters
  -cause: maybe VWF production⬆️
  -experience of caplacizumab limited

- Transplant-associated (TA-) TMA:
  -high mortality❗️
  -etiology is myriad
  -~8% of BMT patients
  -historically, plasma exchange was mainstay of treatment
  BUT
  -with recognition that ADAMTS13 levels in TA-TMA are mostly normal, strategies have shifted away from this approach

- TA-TMA treatment:
  -Elucidation of complement in development of TA-TMA shifted treatment toward terminal complement inhibition with eculizumab and MASP-2 inhibition with narsoplimab
  -Prospective data on eculizumab still limited to children
  -more evidence needed

- Narsoplimab for TA-TMA:
  -IV once weekly for 4-8 weeks
  -Response rate: 61%, similar across subgroups
  -Improvement in organ function in 74%
  -100-day survival after TA-TMA diagnosis was 94% in responders

- Autoimmune TMA:
  -SLE, scleroderma renal crisis or catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS)
  -Case reports describe use of eculizumab in SLE-TMA
  -~30% of CAPS show renal TMA with 36% morality 👉glucocorticoids, anticoagulants + IVIG

- Summary of TMA:
  ❗️Array of manifestations, CHALLENGING
  ❗️High morbidity + mortality
  ❗️Renal involvement is common
  ❗️Suspect: MAHA, thrombopenia
  ❗️rule out other causes
  ❗️rapid assessment, diagnosis + treatment essential
  ❗️TA-TMA very serious
  ❗️Eculizumab, narsoplimab new options https://t.co/jSsRscN7Wn ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NicoGagelmann/status/1663383376949043201))
