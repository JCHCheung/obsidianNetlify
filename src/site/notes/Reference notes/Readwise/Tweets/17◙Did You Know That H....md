## Highlights
- 1/7
  Did you know that HEYDE SYNDROME, which today is defined by a triad of 1) aortic stenosis, 2) recurrent bleeding from GI angiodysplasia, and 3) acquired type IIA von Willebrand syndrome was first described by Edward Heyde in a 1958 correspondence to the NEJM?

  ... and that he described the association of calcific aortic stenosis and massive GI bleeding (not angiodysplasia per se, and certainly not with any understanding of pathogenesis).

  MECHANSISM
  The current leading hypothesis explaining the pathophysiology of Heyde’s syndrome is acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS): ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/WilliamAird4/status/1627405508431818753))

  MECHANSISM (cont'd)
  1. Stenotic aortic valve causes shearing/depletion of high molecular weight (HMW) von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers, leading to acquired type IIA von Willebrand syndrome (AVS). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/WilliamAird4/status/1627405509786578944))

  MECHANISM (Cont'd)
  2. Depletion of HMW VWF leads to loss of VWF-mediated repression of angiogenesis, resulting in formation of angiodysplasias. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/WilliamAird4/status/1627405511078428672))

  MECHANISM (Cont'd)
  3. Angiodyplastic vessels present in patients with AVS, coupled with the depletion of HMW VWF, increase the risk for GI bleeding. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/WilliamAird4/status/1627405512349212673))

  TREATMENT
  1. Treatment of acute GI bleeding with endoscopic procedures and VWF concentrate/DDAVP.
  2. Valvular repair/replacement. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/WilliamAird4/status/1627405513674588161))
