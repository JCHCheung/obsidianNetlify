## Highlights
- The Senning procedure requires tissue rearrangement that is difficult to understand. This beautiful cardiac CT visually demonstrates the fates of the different tissues from an #ACHD double switch patient.

- Challenge 1 is understanding the flow of blood. Here are labels to help. 
  Challenge 2 (relevant for #EPeeps) is understanding the origins of the tissues used in the reconstruction, as they retain their original electrical connections except where incised‚Ä¶

- Here is the classic diagram (flipped from surgical view to imaging view) and CT in color:
  - Red - atrial septum
  - Orange - hinge point of septum and free wall at Waterston‚Äôs groove
  - Yellow - RA free wall
  - Green - front of left PVs
  - Blue - ‚ÄúCoumadin ridge‚Äù / front of right PVs

- I was struck in this CT how well preserved (despite years of somatic growth) are the thickness of the ridge and the right-angle nature of the hinge point between former septum and former free wall, serving as landmarks to understand the surgical anatomy

- Challenge 3 is to the surgeons who manage to construct such intricate repairs, often in young infants.
  Challenge 4 is to the electrophysiologist, who has to understand the fate of infolded ‚ÄúL‚Äù of free wall and septum to appreciate the flutter circuits.

- And finally, a small tip about how to place atrial leads when pacing these patients, beware the phrenic. 
  Also the V leads are not easy. They like to go on the basal/mid free wall with high risk for pacemaker induced cardiomyopathy. Work hard for apex of pancaked ventricle. https://t.co/npeM4HUnTz ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_vinocur/status/1637604648545656837))
