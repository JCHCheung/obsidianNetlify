## Highlights
- 1/10
  Many labs can be abnormally high OR low. 
  Others appear to have just one direction of abnormality. But some diagnoses may be suggested by the "reverse abnormality." For example, a...
  ↓aPTT
  ↓Alk phos
  ↓ALT
  ↑B12
  ↓HDL
  ...may mean something.
  Let's have a look. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tony_breu/status/1602051559323484163))

  ⚡️Low aPTT⚡️
  If a high aPTT raises the concern for a coagulopathy, does that mean a low aPTT should raise the concern for thrombosis?
  Maybe. 
  Multiple studies have shown an INCREASED risk of venous thromboembolism with low aPTT.
  It may be a clue!

  ⚡️Low alkaline phosphatase (ALP)⚡️
  One study looked at 69,864 ALP levels. Just 0.2% (88) were very low (<30 U/L).
  The most common etiology was cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass. The mechanism of this association isn't clear.

  Other rare diagnoses are associated with low ALP.
  One is hypophosphatasia. Consider this diagnosis in those with repeatedly low ALP, particularly if they have a history of fracture.

  Another rare diagnosis that can present with sporadically low ALP is Wilson's disease. I cover this in a separate thread.

  ⚡️Low alanine aminotransferase (ALT)⚡️
  I have previously covered the connection between vitamin B6 and ALT. More specifically, low B6 levels can lead to low ALT. This is seen in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

  Because B6 is a water-soluble vitamin, there is some evidence that patients receiving hemodialysis are at increased risk of deficiency.
  Result: the use of hemodialysis is also associated with lower ALT.

  ⚡️Low HDL⚡️
  It's not uncommon to see a low HDL. But the presence of newly low HDL should raise the concern for a paraprotein. 
  Particularly when the HDL is undetectable!

  ⚡️High vitamin B12⚡️
  High B12 is associated with myeloproliferative disorders (e.g., CML, PV, ET). 
  I explain the mechanism in a separate thread. Have a look.

  There are surely other causes of the often unobserved findings outlined above.
  What are other examples of "reverse abnormalities" you use as clues? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tony_breu/status/1602051598095732736))
