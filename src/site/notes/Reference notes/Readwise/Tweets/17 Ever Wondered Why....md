- 2/7 History
  First described in 1953 by Osborn (camel-hump sign) upon #hypothermia in dogs. Upon systemic analysis similar #ECG patterns have been described in
  ‚û°Ô∏è hypercalcemia
  ‚û°Ô∏è brain injury
  ‚û°Ô∏è SAB
  ‚û°Ô∏è vasospastic angina / ischemia ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realdocdan/status/1561800981821755396))
- 3/7 Emslie-Smith et al showed that Osborn waves manifested more in epicardial than endocardial leads. Others finally showed that 4-aminopyridine sensitive transient outward current (Ito) is responsible and predominantly located in epicardium. ‚¨áÔ∏è heart rate led to ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Ito current ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realdocdan/status/1561800984547844096))
- 4/7 above mentioned triggers of Osborn waves open K-ATP channels, generating outward current during action potential notch. Due to channel distribution this happens more in epicardium than endocardium ‚û°Ô∏è transmural voltage gradient ‚û°Ô∏è resulting in typical ECG morphology. #EPeeps

- 5/7Why are Osborn waves assoc w/ v-fib?
  Due to overactivation of transient outward current (Ito), potential at phase 1 of ventricular action potential (notch) is more negative, inhibiting inward calcium current. This can lead to loss of dome/plateau (2), triggering v-fib. #EPeeps

- 6/7 Clinical significance of Osborn wave
  Observing the Osborn wave in patients - even without hypothermia - can be a red flag and precursor of ventricular arrhythmias and is positively correlated with increased in-hospital mortality. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/realdocdan/status/1561801004018016256))
