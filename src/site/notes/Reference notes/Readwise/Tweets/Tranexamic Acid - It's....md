## Highlights
- 🚩 Tranexamic Acid - it's complicated....
  ➡️It's widely used for treatment & prevention of haemorrhage
  ➡️It's in the WHO's List of Essential Medicines & recommended in the European Traumatic Haemorrhage guideline (2023)
  ➡️But is it as efficacious as we think?

- 🚩 History
  ➡️Drs. Utako & Shosuke Okamoto invented TXA in 1962
  ➡️They identified that the amino acid lysine inhibited the degradation of plasmin, a profibrinolytic enzyme
  ➡️Lysine was modified to first produce Epsilon- Amino-Caproic Acid and later TXA, x 27 more potent

- 🚩 Pharmacology
  ➡️TXA is a molecular analog of lysine 
  ➡️It inhibits fibrinolysis by preventing the binding of plasminogen to fibrin
  ➡️This inhibits plasmin formation & displaces plasminogen from the fibrin surface
  ➡️It also has effects on the immune system & inflammation

- 🚩Landmark Trials
  A number of major TXA trials for acute bleeding have been published over the past 13 years, with varying results
  ➡️CRASH-2 & STAAMP - traumatic haemorrrhage
  ➡️WOMAN - Post partum haemorrhage
  ➡️HALT-IT - Upper GI bleeding
  ➡️CRASH-3 & Rowell - TBI

- 🚩CRASH-2
  ➡️The landmark CRASH-2 trial was published in 2010 
  ➡️20,211 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding were randomised to TXA or placebo
  ➡️all-cause mortality ⬇️ by 1.5% (14.5% vs 16%)
  ➡️risk of death from bleeding ⬇️ by 15% (4.9% vs 5.7%)

- 🚩STAAMP
  ➡️STAAMP was published in 2020
  ➡️903 adults at risk for hemorrhage after trauma
  ➡️prehospital administration of tranexamic acid or placebo
  ➡️30 day mortality 8.1% vs 9.9% (difference, –1.8%; 95% CI, –5.6% to 1.9%; P = 0.17)

- 🚩Rowell Trial
  ➡️Published 2020
  ➡️1063 patients with moderate - severe TBI
  ➡️20 hospitals, 39 EMS in 2 countries
  ➡️primary outcome - favorable neurologic function at 6 months (GOSE >4) 
  ➡️results were similar: 65% vs 62% (P = 0.84)

- 🚩CRASH-3
  ➡️Published 2019
  ➡️12737 TBI patients
  ➡️175 hospitals in 29 countries
  ➡️primary outcome was head injury-related death in hospital within 28 days of injury in patients treated within 3 h of injury
  ➡️results were similar: 18.5% v 19.8% (RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.86–1.02)

- 🚩WOMAN
  ➡️Published 2017
  ➡️20,060 women with post-partum haemorrhage
  ➡️193 hospitals in 21 countries
  ➡️primary outcome - composite of death or hysterectomy < 42 days
  ➡️results were similar: 5.3% vs 5·5%; P=0.65
  ➡️death from bleeding was ⬇️ with TXA (1.5% vs 1.9%; P=0.045)

- 🚩HALT-IT
  ➡️Published 2020
  ➡️12,009 pts with acute GI bleed
  ➡️164 hospitals in 15 countries
  ➡️primary outcome - death due to bleeding within 5 days
  ➡️results were similar: 4% vs 4% (RR 0·99, 95% CI 0·82–1·18)
  ➡️TXA caused ⬆️ venous thromboembolic events (0.8% vs 0.4%)

- 🚩But, but, but...
  ➡️Following CRASH-2, TXA has been widely used and investigated in various haemorrhagic conditions
  ➡️Despite being a large international RCT, CRASH-2 raised many questions & divided opinion

- 🚩Mechanism of Effect
  ➡️The mechanism of effect in CRASH-2 wasn't clear
  ➡️Rates of blood transfusion were similar
  ➡️Little data was available to explore other potential effects of TXA as the responsible mediator

- 🚩Timing Issue
  ➡️There was an apparent differential response according to the timing of TXA administration
  ➡️< 1 hour - mortality 5.3% vs 7.7%
  ➡️1-3 hours - mortality 4.8% vs 6.1%
  ➡️> 3 hours - mortality 4.4% vs 3.1%

- 🚩Generalisability 
  ➡️98% of patients came from outside high income countries
  ➡️would TXA still be beneficial within a more comprehensive trauma system?
  ➡️would more advanced treatments dilute its effects?
  ➡️blood products / interventional radiology / REBOA 😉

- 🚩Specificity
  ➡️The inclusion criteria have limited utility in recognising haemorrhage
  ➡️HR > 110/min & SBP < 90 mmHg
  ➡️neither do they identify acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) in pts who are more likely to benefit 
  ➡️including non ATC patients may ⬆️ thromboses risk

- 🚩PATCH Trial
  ➡️Enter the PATCH Trial
  ➡️Pre-hospital Anti-fibrinolytics for Traumatic Coagulopathy and Haemorrhage
  ➡️TXA (starting prehospital) vs placebo in 1316 patients with severe trauma at risk of ATC
  ➡️Australia / NZ / Germany
  ➡️Primary Outcome GOSE at 6 months
