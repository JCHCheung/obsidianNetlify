## Highlights
- ESR-CRP discordance,a #MedTwitter #tweetorial 
  First off, let‚Äôs talk about ESR physiology. 
  ESR is the rate at which RBCs settle in plasma of an anti coagulated blood sample. 
  (-) charged RBCs repel each other thus ‚¨áÔ∏è ESR.

- In the presence of (+) charged large asymmetric proteins, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è neutralization and RBC aggregation causes ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ESR. Which of the following physiological conditions would have an increased ESR ?

- That‚Äôs right. Pregnancy. In the 1900s, based on differences in ESR between pregnant and non-pregnant women, it was used as a test of pregnancy. This was due to physiological increase of fibrinogen production in pregnancy. 
  Other proteins like Immunoglobulins also ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ESR. (3/12) https://t.co/gVp0gCDXeQ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/sriramsunilk/status/1526541041264111616))
- In Anemia, ‚¨áÔ∏è RBC count ‚¨áÔ∏è (-) charges and thus ‚¨ÜÔ∏èESR.
  While both Fibrinogen(Acute phase reactant) and Ig are ‚¨ÜÔ∏è in inflammation, they have a long t 1/2 (100 hr for Fib; 14 days for IgG). 
  Thus ESR remains elevated for days to weeks after resolution of inflammation.

- CRP was discovered when precipitation was observed in the plasma of patients with Pneumococcal PNA which decreased as patients recovered. They later uncovered that some protein had reacted with the C-polysaccharide of Pneumococcus and christened it C Reactive Protein.

- CRP is a Pattern Recognition Protein(PRR) synthesised by the liver in response to inflammation and is mediated by IL-1,IL-6 and TNF. CRP has a low t1/2 (~6h) and falls quickly once inflammation resolves and synthesis stops. In what condition can CRP be falsely low ?

- That‚Äôs right ! Hepatic Failure. Let‚Äôs recap: 
  ESR: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è in Dz with increased plasma proteins or increased fibrinogen (infections, autoimmune Dz, MM, thrombotic Dz) 
  CRP: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è in Dz with inflammation (usually 2/2 infection/trauma)
  Normal ESR and CRP: IBS, Fibromyalgia, CFS

- How to use ESR and CRP: 
  ESR and CRP have poor sensitivity and specificity for most diseases. In patients with a high pre-test probability,a positive result helps aid a definitive diagnosis and vice versa. They have little significance with intermediate pre-test suspicion.

- ESR and CRP both typically ‚¨ÜÔ∏è with inflammation. However in 12% of üè• patients,ESR and CRP values did not move in the same direction. ESR-CRP discordance can happen because of many reasons. 
  a) in cases of recently resolved inflammations, ESR may still be ‚¨ÜÔ∏è due to ‚¨ÜÔ∏èt1/2.

- b)IG4 Dz & Myeloma - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è globulins may ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏èESR while CRP is normal/mildly ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
  c)RA - CRP ‚¨ÜÔ∏è rapidly while ESR may slowly ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
  d)SLE- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏èIFN-alpha causes suppression of CRP synthesis
  e)MI, VTE, mucosal infections - poor sensitivity of ESR in these Dz
