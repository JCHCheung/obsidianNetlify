## Highlights
- In honor of vancomycin's 65th birthday this week, and @drtoddlee's challenge, here's another potential example where linezolid is superior ... MRSA pneumonia!

- Yes, linezolid is *probably* superior to vanco for MRSA pneumonia.
  It's not definitive -- this meta analysis evaluating 7 RCTs found superiority in microbiologic and clinical cure, but not mortality. https://t.co/J8jJorqfLi

- The largest of the RCTs is this one from around a decade ago. It caused quite the controversy at the time, largely because of the staggering cost of branded linezolid vs generic vancomycin -- a price difference no longer relevant.

- Other cited reasons for disbelieving the favorable results were the unbalanced baseline characteristics and high number of patients excluded to reach the per-protocol group.
  Fair. But I still thought $$$ was the dominant concern -- it cost 10x more than vanco at the time.

- (FYI, the study was called "ZEPHyR" -- part of a long tradition of weird capitalization rules for clinical trial names, making them hard to type.)

- ZEPHyR built on a post-hoc analysis of two RCTs of nosocomial pneumonia, which found that survival and clinical cure were significantly improved in the MRSA pneumonia subgroup when treated with linezolid, compared with vancomycin.

- Why might linezolid be superior to vancomycin for this indication?
  An accompanying editorial cites some animal models.
  In addition, linezolid avoids vanco's nephrotoxicity, a major concern in critically ill patients.

- What do the guidelines say? Both the CAP and the hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated pneumonia guidelines say *either* vancomycin or linezolid are options.
  Choose based on patient factors. Right @DrAndreKalil?

- To sum up, data suggest that linezolid is at least as good -- and may be better -- than vanco in treatment of MRSA pneumonia.
  All things being equal, it's my choice for a condition that has such high mortality.
  And Happy Birthday, Vanco! You're now eligible for medicare.
