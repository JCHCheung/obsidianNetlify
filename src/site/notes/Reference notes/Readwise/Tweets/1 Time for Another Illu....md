## Highlights
- 1/ Time for another illustrative learning case in the form of a üßµ#tweetorial #medtwitter #neurotwitter #neurocriticalcare #neurology. Case deidentified as always https://t.co/4kdARnTxrw ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219367894728704))
- 2/ Young human with no medical history but IVDA (heroin, cocaine, PCP) with multiple prior overdoses and recent discharge from drug rehab 2 days prior who presents to #ED after acting funny ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219371027775489))
- 3/They were noted to be lethargic, GCS 13, not able to provide history. CT demonstrates cerebellar edema with #hydrocephalus (üíß) and some ‚¨ÜÔ∏è transtentorial üß† herniation

- 5/ They become hypoxemic and bradycardic. Panic! What do you do? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219381064736768))
- 6/ Phew, they improved with narcan! Don‚Äôt forget to look at the eyes! His pupils were small! üòÖThe next day, still confused but somehow non focal, GCS14. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219382025224192))
- 7/ MRI (shown) w/ patchy DWI, transependymal edema on FLAIR and leptomeningeal enhancement c/f cerebellitis on T1 post but broad differential

- 8/ Work up that ensues includes HIV, quantiferon, mycoplasma, CMV negative. + EBV and hepatitis C (chronic). LP üíânot obtained due to risk of herniation. MRI spine with some enhancement of roots. CT C/A/P w/o other malignancy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219389574971395))
- 9/ Repeat MRI 1 week later is unchanged, leading differential syphilis or TB, also sarcoidosis. Given persistent üíß, EVD placed and revealed 655 WBC, 4 RBC, protein 10, glu 82, and the following (-): VDRL/cytology/crypto/ACE/culture ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219390560641027))
- 10/ The usual suspects are thrown out: Erdheim-Chester, CLIPPERS, histiocytosis. Search is broadened with autoimmune work up. Paraneoplastic panel negative üôÑ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219391558975489))
- 11/ The patient has symptomatic improvement after CSF diversion but would you shunt this person without knowing etiology? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219392775241728))
- 12/ We clamped the EVD and the patient tolerated it. This was removed after 48 hours and repeat imaging without additional hydro. Repeat MRI later showed no üíß recurrence but persistent enhancement and edema

- 13/ The patient then went for bx and this revealed necrotizing granulomas with pleomorphic yeast noted concerning for histo vs crypto (but crypto serum and csf negative) üò© ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219400790609920))
- 14/ They were started on ampho and flucytosine and had symptomatic improvement but then cultures revealed gram + rods! Meanwhile serum/urine histo negative. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219401793097730))
- 15/ Hmmmm what could be responsive to antifungals but is not histo or crypto? ü§î ID became concerned for nocardia or actinomyces. However, cryptococcus PCR came back from biopsy PCR= final diagnosis and GPCs were p.acnes related ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219402690568197))
- 16/ Crypto is an opportunistic infection usually in the immunocompromised (HIV, transplant, steroids though 1/3 w/o in case series of 157) and p/w meningoencephalitis following inhalation.¬†

- 17/ presentation is variable, months to days, and non specific (HA, fever, lethargy). Dx via encapsulated yeast on India Ink stain, PCR from CSF. CSF usually reveals ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Wbc/protein and low glucose though these can be normal as in our case. (Image from: https://t.co/qIM1z3O4YB)

- 18/ Treatment consists of induction with anti-fungal: ampho B + flucytosine x 2 weeks, though this is often extended 4-6 weeks, depending on comorbidities, seizures, üß† involvement ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219408541720576))
- 19/ Repeat LP üíâ at 2 weeks to assess for ongoing crypto in CSF and determine if patient is ready for consolidation therapy if immunocompromised or non-compromised but severe (as out pt) but not o/w. Consolidation tx = fluconazole x 8 weeks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219409485447169))
- 20/ If no mass lesion or üíß, should also do LP to assess ICP. If elevated can do daily LPs vs. lumbar drain/EVD and this series shows 2/3 of those with VP shunt did ok long term 
  https://t.co/VCouvB0vH9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rkchoi/status/1542219410454331393))
- End/ Prognosis is typically linked to underlying reason for immunocompromised and severity of infection.
