## Highlights
- The history of methotrexate began 75 years ago.
  A short 🧵 on its history and pivotal moments, covering key trials to show realignment of #hematology #rheumatology, disciplines that belong to each other♥️

- In the early 1940s, folic acid was isolated and found to cure some patients with megaloblastic anemia, not responding to vitamin B 12. 
  Also, patients with acute leukemia were treated with folic acid or folate conjugates (polyglutamated forms of folic acid)
  👉proved ineffective:(

- The subsequent demonstration by Heinle and Welch that a diet-induced deficiency of folic acid caused a decrease in the leukemia cell count, stimulated efforts, primarily by the Lederle group, to synthesize analogs of folic acid.

- Era of chemotherapy:
  -Aminopterin (4-aminopterolylglutamic acid),
  proved to be a powerful antagonist, shown by Farber et al in a landmark paper, to produce remissions in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) 
  -nitrogen mustard caused regressions in patients with lymphoma

- Aminopterin interfered with proliferation of connective tissue. This led to a study in 1951 by Gubner et al. in several patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis👉rapid improvement in RA signs and symptoms 6/7 seven patients

- In 1956, studies of leukemia-bearing mice showed that methotrexate, another folate analog, had a therapeutic index superior to that of´aminopterin; based on these studies, methotrexate supplanted
  aminopterin in the clinic. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/NicoGagelmann/status/1646422879410462722))
- Lessons learnt early:
  -drug resistance occurs rapidly if cure is not achieved (for most tumors within 4-6 months)👉treatment failure
  -curable diseases with drugs: Hodgkin's, DLBCL, certain childhood solid tumors
  -treatment with MTX not associated with long term
  side effects

- Other drugs were also found to be useful in the treatment of ALL, in particular 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), prednisone, and vincristine.
  A very important study by the Acute Leukemia B cooperative group showed that 6MP-MTX was better than either drug used alone.

- The next major advance (1971, 1978) that led to cures in 50% of the patients was the use of intrathecal methotrexate with adequate central nervous system (CNS) irradiation, for prophylaxis of sanctuary disease.

- In 1972, Rex Hoffmeister, reported positive effects with intramuscular MTX (10-15 mg per week) in 29 patients with RA. 11/2929 patients had “major” clinical improvements and 14 had “moderate” improvements in RA activity. These patients underwent treatment for up to 25 months.

- In 1983, a RCT crossover study of 35 patients with refractory RA was done.
  Initial MTX dose: 7.5 mg per week with an increase at 6 weeks to 15 mg/w.
  - 3 weeks after MTX initiation: >50% with >50% improved joint tenderness index
  - 39% with improvement in the joint swelling index

- The other pivotal study was an NIH-funded study network of 189 patients with active RA. Patients initially received MTX at 7.5 mg per week with dose escalation to 15 mg per week.
  -32% had >50% decrease in the joint tenderness index
  -21% with reduction in joint swelling index

- Graft-versus-host disease:
  In 1986, Storb and colleagues reported that the combination of MTX with cyclosporine A was superior to CSA alone in a series of prospective randomized phase 3 trials. This remains one of the most widely used regimen today as prophylaxis regimen in BMT.

- If we go back in time 75 years and tell Dr Farber, that 21st-century medicine would utilize MTX more in rheumatology but also show the widespread use in oncology and hematology, he might scratch his head...that's a lovely thought, showing the beauty of medical research!
  Fin.
