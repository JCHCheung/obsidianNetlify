## Highlights
- @NephroP @kyliebaker888 I read a while ago that a pressure gradient between the hepatic venous pressure & portal pressure is < 5 mmHg, however you don’t really get big problems until this gradient exceeds 10-12 mmHg or so. Adding this to gradient to a CVP would be a pressure well above Pmsf I think. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/khaycock2/status/1558222264692195328))
