## Highlights
- 1/🏥It's your first night alone in the CCU 
  😵‍💫You admit a patient with syncope due to complete heart block 
  🕡HR is 30 bpm with a wide ventricular escape rhythm 
  You wonder if it's time for your first #TVP, but 
  🔆is it indicated? 
  🔆& how are you going to set it up for success? https://t.co/QsFjhqeSSZ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825269241266176))
- 2/ Learning Objectives:
  🔆Recognize indications for pacing 
  🔆How to manage TVP/adjust settings ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825272244387841))
- 3/ But first let’s start with a huge thank you to @AmitGoyalMG @A_h_ghoneem and @RichardAFerraro for their never-ending guidance and help making this happen! 👏🏼

- 5/ Let's first take a vote 🗳️ 
  I feel comfortable identifying patients who may require a TVP and troubleshooting common TVP problems ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825279525707776))
- 6/ What are the most common indications for TVP? 🤔 
  🔆Bradyarrhythmia à symptoms😵‍💫or hemodynamic compromise 🏥(eg. sinus bradycardia, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block) 
  🔆Overdrive pacing (eg. VT, TdP) 
  🔆Digoxin toxicity💊 
  🔆PPM Failure

- 7/ So let’s get to know our TVP settings better🤓 
  For our case, our TVP mode will be VVI 
  V=Ventricle sensed 
  V=Ventricle paced 
  I=pacing Inhibited if native beat is sensed 
  Vs the other common mode of VOO 
  V=Ventricle paced 
  O=not sensed 
  O=no inhibition of pacing ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825282797264896))
- 8/ Although there are different types of generators, they all have the same 3 variables that you can control: 
  🕑Rate 
  ⚡️Output 
  ⚠️Sensitivity 
  Let’s start with Rate🕑meaning the number of impulses generated by your TVP/minute

- 9/ Next, let’s look at the Output ⚡️which is the current🔌produced by the generator during every beat (measured in milliAmpers, mA) 
  The⬆️the mA, the⬆️the output 
  (obvious right? wait until you see what's coming next though😉)

- 10/ Finally, let’s talk about Sensitivity ⚠️which is the minimum current 🔌needed to detect native cardiac activity and inhibit pacing 🫀(measured in millivolts, mV) 
  🚨Don’t be fooled! 
  The⬇️the mV, the ⬇️ current is needed to be detected by the TVP so the⬆️the sensitivity!

- 11/ To make sure we really understand the concept of sensitivity ⚠️ 
  Let’s look at our favorite sensitivity analogy where you’re the pacer trying to see the QRS complex from behind a fence 👇🏻 
  Fence = mV 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fn5PsxnaYAAJqbs.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825294033813508))
- 12/ 🚨So let’s go back to the CCU! 
  Your patient now has a TVP, rate is set at 60 bpm, output 10, sensitivity 8, but you see this on tele 👇🏻 
  So, 
  What is the problem?🤔 
  What are potential causes? 📋 
  How can you troubleshoot it? 🔧

- 13/ 🚨Prob = undersensing ⚠️ 
  Pacer doesn’t detect intracardiac signal🫀(native QRS) ➡️asynchronous pacing 
  Possible causes➡️low sensitivity (fence too high), electrolyte abnormality, lead failure ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825299402522624))
- 14/ ✅ How to correct? 
  ⬆️sensitivity by ⬇️mV, this allows pacer to detect more cardiac signals🫀 
  Review reversible causes such as electrolytes🩸 
  Check hardware (lead placement)🛠️

- 15/ You ⬆️sensitivity from 8 mV to 7 mV ➡️you are no longer seeing asynchronous pacing (no inappropriate pacing spikes after native QRS) 
  You cut down mV to roughly half (7 mV ➡️4 mV) and perfecto!👌🏼 
  Your patient is being paced at a rate of 60 bpm and feels great!👏🏼 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825303563272200))
- 16/ Congratulations! First curveball dodged! 
  But now, your patient’s tele shows this 👇🏻 
  So, let’s try this again 
  What is the problem?🤔 
  What are potential causes? 📋 
  How can you troubleshoot it? 🔧 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fn5R9NtaQAAlifh.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825305081597953))
- 17/ 🚨Prob = capture 🥅 failure 
  An impulse is generated by pacer but it does not cause myocardial depolarization🫀 
  (pacing spikes not followed by QRS complexes) 
  Possible causes➡️lead dislodgment, low output ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825307619131392))
- 18/ ✅ How to correct? 
  Increase output⚡️by increasing mA 
  Check lead positioning ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825309317836801))
- 19/You ⬆️ output from 10 mA to 12 mA ➡️ each pacing spike is now followed by a QRS complex (capture achieved! 👏🏼) 
  You double your output to 24 mA, and the patient feels great! 🥳 
  But why do you need such a high output? 🤔 
  Check your lead position, it probably moved! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825310794219521))
- 20/ Amazing job so far! But wait, you now look at tele and you see this 👇🏻 
  Your patient is in complete heart block again! And there are no pacing spikes at all! 💔 
  So, one last time folks 🦾 
  What is the problem?🤔
  What are potential causes? 📋 
  How can you troubleshoot it? 🔧

- 21/ it could be one of two problems: 
  DDx 1: Oversensing ⚠️ 
  Pacer senses signals it shouldn’t (eg. T waves or P waves) thinking they are QRS complexes ➡️ inappropriate inhibition of pacing 
  Possible causes➡️ high sensitivity (fence too low), lead failure ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825314942406656))
- 22/ 🚨DDx 2: output⚡️failure 
  Native HR < set rate🕑, but still no pacing 
  (no pacing spikes when there should be pacing spikes) 
  Possible causes ➡️lead failure, generator failure, battery failure, oversensing ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825316599148545))
- 23/ So how can you trouble shoot? 🔧 
  ⬇️ sensitivity by ⬆️ mV (bring the fence up), will overcome both DDx! 
  Check hardware (as below) 🛠️

- 24/ General check list 📜to go through when troubleshooting🧑🏻‍🔧 
  -generator on? 🔛 
  -Battery low? 🪫 
  -Wires attached well? 
  -Leads connected?🔌 
  -Could the TVP wire have been displaced? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825321242251265))
- 25/ So lets ask again now 👀 
  I feel comfortable identifying patients who may require a TVP and troubleshooting common TVP problems🦸🏾‍♀️ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825323528163333))
- 26/ I learned something in this Tweetorial that may change my clinical practice🤓 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RawanAAmir/status/1620825961926369280))
- 27/ Congratulations on making it to the end of this thread and for keeping your patient alive in the CCU! 🥳 
  Thank you so much for listening and hope you learned something new from this little tweetorial 📚
