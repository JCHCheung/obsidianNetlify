## Highlights
- With #ASCO23 and #ICML23 just around the corner we'll hear a lot about PD1 inhibition and #Hodgkin lymphoma. 
  What's all the fuss about? Follow this thread to understand more.

- Reed-Sternberg cells (malig cell in Hodgkin) strongly express PDL1 due to amplification of 9p24 which contains the PDL1 & PDL2 locus. 
  An exuberant microenvironment includes plenty of PD1+ T-cells and other immune cells.

- Despite MHC class 1 & beta-2-microglobulin often not being expressed by RS cells, PD1 inhibitors are more active in Hodgkin lymphoma than in any other cancer. 
  Mechanism of action not fully known. 
  ?removes PD1-PDL1 mediated growth signal
  ?enables CD4+ cytotoxic T-cells to kill.

- Initial trials of pembrolizumab (Keynote 087) & nivolumab (checkmate 205) showed similar ORR of around 65-70%. 
  Most of these patients had prior brentuximab & an autologous SCT (although different cohorts were included with slightly different eligibility). 
  Led to first approvals

- Confirmatory trial for Pembro was Keynote 204: pembro vs BV in R/R Hodgkin not suitable for ASCT. Included older 'unfit' patients and younger pts who were not in a good enough remission for ASCT. 
  Some quirks to this trial but Primary EP (PFS) was longer with pembro.

- Studies in other cancer types: PD1i make good chemo combination partner. 
  Tried in Hodgkin with BV or chemo at 1st relapse with excellent response rates & many bridged to transplant. 
  Nivo+BV: CMR 67%
  Pembro+GVD: CMR 95%
  Nivo+ICE: 89%

- 1st line studies next:
  - cohort D checkmate 205: safety confirmed
  - Allen et al (fig): Pembro prior to AVD
  - Lynch et al: Pembro concurrent with AVD
  - Brockelmann et al: prior to or concurrent with AVD
  All small non-randomised but excellent responses with few (if any) relapses.

- Stage is set for SWOG1826. Randomised phase 3 study comparing BV-AVD with Nivo-AVD in advanced (stage III/IV) disease. 
  Control arm was the winner of ECHELON-1 which compared 6x ABVD with 6x AVD-BV.
  We are told primary endpoint met. Looking forward to the data.

- BUT - will global practise change?
  Many non-US sites use escBEACOPP 1st line as cures 90% of even stage IV disease.
  HD21 assessing BrECADD as a less toxic but possibly as effective alternative. Initial results encouraging. 
  My hunch is front line debates are here to stay!
