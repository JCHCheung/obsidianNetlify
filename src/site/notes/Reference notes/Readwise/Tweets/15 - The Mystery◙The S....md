## Highlights
- 1/5 - The Mystery
  The serum LDH in TTP is more than twice that seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)
  ü§îIf the source of LDH in both conditions is lysed RBCs, shouldn't the values should be similar? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tony_breu/status/1573717588072448000))
- 2/5 - The Proof
  Let's start by confirming that the LDH in TTP is higher than what's seen in AIHA:
  ‚òûAIHA: ~700-800 IU/L (median)
  ‚òûTTP: ~1500 IU/L (mean)

- 3/5 - The Answer
  üí°The main source of LDH in TTP isn't lysed red blood cells.
  Recall that there are multiple LDH isoenzymes. RBCs contain LDH-1 and LDH-2, so these should be the main type elevated in TTP. They aren't.

- 4/5 - The Evidence
  One study looked at the LDH isoenzymes in patients with TTP.
  The percentage of LDH-1 and LDH-2 were not elevated above normal.
  üîëInstead, the percentage of LDH-5, the isoenzyme found in skeletal muscle and liver was elevated.

- 5/5 - The Implications
  ‚ö°Ô∏èThe authors of this study propose that the elevated LDH in TTP reflects tissue injury as a result of microvascular ischemia. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tony_breu/status/1573717599619252225))
