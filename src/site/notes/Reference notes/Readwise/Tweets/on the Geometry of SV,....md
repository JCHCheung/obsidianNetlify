## Highlights
- üßµ on the geometry of SV, EF and MAPSE.
  1: SV is proportional to MAPSE x outer LV area. https://t.co/Iu4n3vZPVF ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/strain_rate/status/1620819095733272576))
- 2/ Left: cavity volume reduction, as function of cavity longitudinal and endocardial shortening. Right: total LV volume = cavity + myocardial volume. Given a minimally incompressible myocardium, ‚¨áÔ∏è in total volume = ‚¨áÔ∏è in cavity volume, as myocardial volume is constant.

- 3/ EF = SV/LVEDV. In dilated ventricles, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è in LVEDV, can maintain (resting) SV, as ‚¨áÔ∏èEF. As SV is proportional to MAPSE x diameter, MAPSE will ‚¨áÔ∏è in close relation to EF as diameter increases

- 4/ In concentric ventricles, The LVEDV is ‚¨áÔ∏è. SV is ‚¨áÔ∏è in proportion. (Thus there is systolic dysfunction), maintained EF is not maintained systolic function, and this is not "diastolic HF". EF is maintained due to concomitant ‚¨áÔ∏è in both LVEDV and SV.

- 5/ LV outer diameter may be ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èor‚¨áÔ∏è, depending on the pattern of wall thickening, but LVIDD and LVEDV are ‚¨áÔ∏è in concentric geometry (per definition). As SV = MAPSE x outer diameter, MAPSE will be ‚¨áÔ∏è in relation to the ‚¨áÔ∏è SV (not EF).

- 6/ the concept that EF is ‚û°Ô∏èthrough an ‚¨ÜÔ∏è short axis function, is misunderstood geometry. In concentric ventricles FS is ‚û°Ô∏èor ‚¨ÜÔ∏è trough ‚¨áÔ∏èLVIDD, despite ‚¨áÔ∏è wall thickening.

- 7/ EF in HFpEF is preserved by simultaneous reduction in SV and LVEDV, MAPSE is ‚¨áÔ∏è, and there is no such thing as "compensatory short axis function. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/strain_rate/status/1620827922142724096))
