## Highlights
- Hey #medtwitter
  Here are the basics on unequal randomization in trials
  Why should we do 1:1 instead of 2:1 or 3:1 in phase 3 RCTs?

- First why do we randomize?
  Prevent bias which is a major limitation in observational studies:
  1âƒ£ Balance known and unknown confounders
  2âƒ£ Prevent immortal time bias
  3âƒ£ Prevent selection bias
  4âƒ£ Contributes to validity of statistical tests ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/vpatelmd/status/1629995356380610560))
- How is randomization typically done?
  Coin flip? If we just flipped a coin, then eventually with large samples the groups would have even numbers. 
  Not ideal for clinical trials where we can't afford unequal groups. Instead there's "restricted randomization" methods... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/vpatelmd/status/1629995358083514370))
- 1âƒ£Permuted Block:
  - Randomize 300 patients for Drug A vs. Drug B
  - Choose a block size, let's say 6
  - # of blocks = 300/6 = 50
  - Each block has equal randomization to A and B
  Block 1: ABBAAB
  Block 2: BAABAB
  Random patterns so that investigators can't predict

- 2âƒ£ Stratified Randomization
  We determine key prognostic factors and ensure even distribution for drug A and drug B
  Each factor is in a stratum that uses permuted block for even distribution
  Example: PD-L1 status
  Ensure similar PD-L1 for A vs. B by using permuted blocks ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/vpatelmd/status/1629995361518649344))
- Here is a great resource on the topic from JAMA:

  We're getting closer to unequal randomization. Reasons 1:1 should be the gold standard. Let's start with sample size ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/vpatelmd/status/1629995363141836800))
- Sample size is determined by power calculation. This is the number of patients needed to detect meaningful differences when they exist. 
  More simply: 
  # of patients to minimize false negatives...don't want to scrap a drug that will actually save lives! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/vpatelmd/status/1629995364890873856))
- Let's say we need 300 patients to power a meaningful difference in OS if we randomize 1:1.
  We have 150 in both groups
  If we randomized 2:1, we need 12% more patients (224 in Drug A and 112 for Drug B) to keep same power.
  If we randomized 3:1, we need 33% more patients... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/vpatelmd/status/1629995366602129410))
- So what's the issue? 
  More people are getting shiny experiemental drug A compared to our standard of care drug B. Isn't that great?
  We are running the trial because there is equipoise. We don't know which is better. So easily could be exposing more patients to a harmful drug ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/vpatelmd/status/1629995368317595648))
- Phase II and III trials showing efficacy of state of the art drug A may be wrong. Trial design is complicated. Uncertainty exists and careful review is critical.
  Think about atezo for TNBC. First trial 1:1 and next trial 2:1. Ultimately, not effective and taken off market. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/vpatelmd/status/1629995370087587842))
- What if these patients could have enrolled on another effective trial?
  Some argue 2:1 increases enrollment, but that isn't scientifically valid. If we have equipoise, this should be clearly articulated during consent to the patient. We must admit uncertainty in phase 3 trials. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/vpatelmd/status/1629995371874373633))
- Bottom line is unequal randomization may increase patient exposure to ineffective therapies. 
  Imagine if we had more power to be more certain of smaller effect sizes by enrolling the same number of patients if we require 1:1 randomization. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/vpatelmd/status/1629995373560500224))
- Papers should state reasons for unequal randomization in the methods. I'm amazed by patient altruisim in enrolling on cancer trials. We don't need 2:1.
  Thank you for reading and open to any comments on the topic. Excited to see @VPrasadMDMPH tackle this on his podcast. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/vpatelmd/status/1629995375225638913))
