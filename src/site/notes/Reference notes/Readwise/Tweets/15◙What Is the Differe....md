  What is the difference between ERYTHROCYTOSIS and POLYCYTHEMIA?
  Although the terms are often used interchangeably, they have slightly different meanings.

  1. ERYTHROCYTOSIS = elevated RBC count. 
  1a. Absolute erythrocytosis is associated with an absolute increase in RBC count.
  1b. Relative erythrocytosis is associated with an apparent increase in RBC count owing to a reduction in plasma volume. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/WilliamAird4/status/1622951859974705154))

  Absolute erythrocytosis with a normal MCV is associated with elevated red cell mass (polycythemia).
  Absolute erythrocytosis with microcytosis (as occurs in thalassemia) may be associated with normal or 
  even low red cell mass (Hct=MVC x RBC count). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/WilliamAird4/status/1622951861782454272))

  2. POLYCYTHEMIA = elevated Hct and/or Hb.
  2a. Absolute polycythemia is associated with an absolute increase in red cell mass, as measured by the RBC mass surrogates Hct and/or Hb.
  2b. Relative polycythemia is an elevated Hb or Hct secondary to reduction in plasma volume. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/WilliamAird4/status/1622951863346946048))

  Absolute polycythemia is usually but not always associated with an absolute increase in RBC count (erythrocytosis) (see graphic). 
  As the name ‘poly’ implies, polycythemia more accurately refers to pan-myeloproliferation, but this definition is not normally adhered to. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/WilliamAird4/status/1622951865033048064))
