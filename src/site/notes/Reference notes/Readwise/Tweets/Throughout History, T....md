## Highlights
- ‚û°Ô∏è Throughout history, the most mystical substance of all has been blood
  ‚û°Ô∏è It has been coveted and desired

- ‚û°Ô∏è Blood has always been a symbol of power
  ‚û°Ô∏è In Greek mythology, ichor, the blood of the Gods, was a golden fluid

  ‚û°Ô∏è The Gods derived their divine powers & longevity from it

- ‚û°Ô∏è Blood has been revered for its restorative properties
  ‚û°Ô∏è Elizabeth B√°thory, a 16th-century Hungarian noblewoman, allegedly killed hundreds of young girls & women
  ‚û°Ô∏è She bathed in their blood to maintain her youth & beauty

- ‚û°Ô∏è Blood was highly valued 
  ‚û°Ô∏è In 1487, the Aztec ruler Ahuitzotl ordered a blood sacrifice to honor the gods Huitzilopochtli & Tlaloc
  ‚û°Ô∏è Over 4 days, up to 80,000 captured warriors had their still-beating hearts cut out on the Great Temple's sacrificial altar

- ‚û°Ô∏è Their bodies were tossed down the temple side and dismembered below
  ‚û°Ô∏è The skulls were added to the tzompantli, or skull rack
  ‚û°Ô∏è The Aztecs believed that Huitzilopochtli, the Sun God, required nourishment from human blood to continue his daily journey across the sky

- ‚û°Ô∏è Blood is also deeply personal, a reflection of one's uniqueness & being
  ‚û°Ô∏è Tales of its theft are psychologically traumatic
  ‚û°Ô∏è One of the best known stories capturing this fear is Bram Stoker's Dracula
  ‚û°Ô∏è Written in 1897, it remains hugely popular & terrifying

- ‚û°Ô∏è Vital for life, blood is also precious
  ‚û°Ô∏è Early attempts to halt bleeding involved many different substances from the natural world
  ‚û°Ô∏è Spiderwebs have been used in many civilisations over time
  ‚û°Ô∏è In addition to their strong laced structure, they also contain vitamin K

- ‚û°Ô∏è In WW1 soldiers from both sides used Sphagnum (bog) moss
  ‚û°Ô∏è With absorbent & antiseptic properties, it promoted clotting & prevent infection
  ‚û°Ô∏è The moss could hold 22 times its volume in blood
  ‚û°Ô∏è It also reduced wound pH, preventing microbial growth

- ‚û°Ô∏è Not all efforts were successful.....
  ‚û°Ô∏è In ancient Rome, the physician Galen documented the use of horse dung for bleeding
  ‚û°Ô∏è It was applied directly to the wound 
  ‚û°Ô∏è The warmth and pressure from the dung were believed to promote clotting & prevent infection

- ‚û°Ô∏è Today, haemostatic measures are slightly more scientific
  ‚û°Ô∏è Tranexamic acid has been tested and is currently recommended for major traumatic haemorrhage
  ‚û°Ô∏è The upcoming @PATCHTrial results will confirm or refute the findings of previous studies like CRASH-2

- @PATCHTrial ‚û°Ô∏è Plasma fibrinogen levels drop in traumatic haemorrhage
  ‚û°Ô∏è Fresh frozen plasma contains ~ 70% of the clotting factors of fresh blood
  ‚û°Ô∏è FFP alone is unable to increase plasma fibrinogen to > 2g/L, similar to normal plasma

- @PATCHTrial ‚û°Ô∏è Cryoprecipitate, rich in fibrinogen, can increase the levels of this haemostatic factor
  ‚û°Ô∏è Whether this is beneficial in traumatic haemorrhage is unknown
  ‚û°Ô∏è The upcoming @CRYOSTAT_2 results presentation at #CCR23 will provide an answer

- @PATCHTrial @CRYOSTAT_2 ‚û°Ô∏è 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate contains coagulation factors II, VII, IX, & X plus proteins S and C
  ‚û°Ô∏è It was hoped it would decrease blood product use in trauma resuscitation & improve outcomes
  ‚û°Ô∏è Sadly, it didn't, but did cause more thrombotic events

- @PATCHTrial @CRYOSTAT_2 ‚û°Ô∏è Published in @JAMA_current current¬†last month, the PROCOAG trial adds to the evidence base for haemostatic resuscitation in trauma
  ‚û°Ô∏è Along with @CRYOSTAT_2, @PATCHTrial & @UKREBOATrial, the best recent trauma trials will be presented together at #CCR23

- @PATCHTrial @CRYOSTAT_2 @JAMA_current @UKREBOATrial ‚û°Ô∏è Join us in @TitanicBelfast to hear the discussions at #CCR23
  ‚û°Ô∏è The chief investigators for all 4 trials will be present
  ‚û°Ô∏è Pierre Bouzat will present the PROCOAG trial
  ‚û°Ô∏è How will we haemostatically resuscitate patients post #CCR23?
