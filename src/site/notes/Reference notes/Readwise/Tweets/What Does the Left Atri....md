- #1 LAA plays a very important capacitance role.
  Animal studies in 1990s showed:
  - LAA is more compliant than LA
  - LAA acts like a decompression chamber during systole
  - The capacitance/reservoir role is key when LAP is elevated
  - Eliminating LAA acutely ‚¨ÜÔ∏è LA pressure in dogs

- - Effect of LAAO on hemodynamics in humans is debatable
  - OBS data ‚û°Ô∏è that LAAO ‚¨ÜÔ∏è LAP, ‚¨áÔ∏è LA transport function, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è HF
  - However, in LAAOS III RCT there was no ‚¨ÜÔ∏è in HF admissions w LAAO
  - Caveat: epicardial closure vs ednocadail plugging of LAA don‚Äôt produce similar effects

- #2 LAA has a hemostatic function
  Data from hemostasis I & II studies & PRAGUE-17 showed that
  - Epicardial LAAO has considerable impact on neurohormonal parameters & BP. This effect was persistent during mid term f/u
  - Endocardial LAAO has minimal or no hormonal or BP impact

- #3 Arrhythmia roles of the LAA
  - LAA is suggested to be an underrecognized source of AF initiation
  - THE BELIEF trial showed that empirical isolation of the LAA ‚¨ÜÔ∏è freedom from AF without increasing complications
  - A meta analysis by Friedman et al confirmed this concept

- - BUT: stroke risk w electrical isolation of LAA was a major concern
  - However, Di Biase et al showed that this risk can be mitigated with appropriate OAC or LAAO
  - LAA may not always be pro-AF. Melduni showed that routine LAAO during surgery was associated w ‚¨ÜÔ∏è post-op AFüëá

- #4 LAA as a source of stem cells
  - In 2000-2010s. several groups showed that the LAA contains a large number of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) - reported to present up to 20% of LAA tissue in some studies!
  - This fueled an interest in the role for LAA in regenerative medicine

- - First in human feasibility studies (Patching the myocardium w LAA CPCs during CABG) has been published
  - A limited number of ‚Äòefficacy‚Äô studies in animals showed a potential role for LAA CPC in myocardial salvage after myocardial infarction

- #5 Coronary protection
  It has been suggested that the left and right atrial appendages overlay & protect the origin of the coronary arteries from the friction associated with the dynamic motion of the heart. However, this proposed function hasn‚Äôt been studied. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adnanalkhouli/status/1558499567867412483))
- In Summary, 
  üìå The LAA has important roles hemodynamic, hemostatic & electrical functions. Our knowledge of those functions is limited. 
  üìå While we continue to learn about this unique structure, we should not discard it as a mere nidus for thrombus. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/adnanalkhouli/status/1558499569943592962))
