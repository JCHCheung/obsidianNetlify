## Highlights
- What is your take on #vasodilators in acute #HeartFailure? The upcoming November issue of #EHJACVC will bring you a PRO/CON "Vasodilator therapy in acute heart failure revisited"
  As our PRO paper was published in advanced access, a sneak preview Tweetorial below...

- First some background...
  Current @escardio guidelines state (IIb, B): "In patients with AHF and a systolic blood pressure (SBP) >110 mmHg, intravenous vasodilators may be considered as an initial therapy to improve symptoms and reduce congestion."
  Only 1 flowchart has them in...

- So far, I consider this a fair recommendation... In hyper/normotensive pulmonary oedema, they might be helpful in some cases, with their main benefit a reduced need for (non-)invasive ventilation!
  Beautiful (older) trial by Gad Cotter on this: https://t.co/pDuXFTHEMo ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FH_Verbrugge/status/1578947799219339265))
- Our PRO viewpoint however is more a critique of this flowchart. Personally, I am really annoyed by this updated version in the guidelines, which carries the risk of increasing the already inappropriately high use of #inotropes or even worse #vasopressors...

- Great effort by @SVanhentenrijk to write this piece, discussing pathophysiology & reasons for vasodilators in AHF, explaining why we need trials in the RIGHT population (low cardiac output w increased systemic vascular resistance).
  Super mentorship by @venumenon10 @WilsonTangMD ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FH_Verbrugge/status/1578947809763815425))
- First, know your drugs, not all #vasodilators are alike...
  Organic nitrates: mainly preload reduction, afterload at higher dose
  Hydralazine: pure afterload reduction
  Nitroprusside: balanced preload/afterload reduction (my favorite in AHF)

- If You remember 1 thing from our paper, let it be: "SBP = awful marker of #afterload or ventriculo-arterial coupling, making it pretty useless in decision to employ #vasodilators"
  If anything vasodilators work best in patients with LOW SBP: https://t.co/wd9JOvtDMb @AlexMebazaa ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FH_Verbrugge/status/1578947820161478657))
- Why is this? Need pressure-volume loops in here:
  In preserved CO/SV (steep Ees~contractility), reducing afterload (Ea) has little impact on stroke volume (SV), which is already high. However, marked impact on BP (preload dependency!)

- In low CO/SV (more flat Ees) however, despite lower SBP to start from, impact of reducing afterload (Ea) on BP is minimal, because lower vascular tonus is compensated by a massive increase in SV (afterload dependency!)

- Thus, as the Great Guyton has teached us:
  Blood pressure is not the same as #Perfusion
  So we need to employ vasodilators in patients who are very vasoconstricted with low #CardiacOutput, typically w low SBP, low #PulsePressure & preserved MAP
  90/70 mmHg means MAP=77 mmHg!!!

- If you have understood this well, who gets vasodilator therapy from you? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FH_Verbrugge/status/1578947868127555584))
- Let's give it some time to reflect... Will come up with the answer tomorrow!
  We finish this perspective w indications for which vasodilators seem as good as their alternatives (diuretics, inotropes, vasopressors mechanical support) for which the line of evidence is thin as well. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FH_Verbrugge/status/1578947871641960448))
- ✅Optimise renal perfusion to enhance decongestion
  ✅Improve perfusion to prevent end-organ damage
  ✅Enabling early optimization of disease-modifying treatments (switch from IV nitroprusside to oral sac/val!)
  ✅Reduce surgical risk by reducing lung water & optimized hemodynamics ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FH_Verbrugge/status/1578947875190415360))
- The CON party, will undoubtedly point towards failing trials with vasodilators in AHF, but look who they recruited, this is no low output #Heartfailure!
