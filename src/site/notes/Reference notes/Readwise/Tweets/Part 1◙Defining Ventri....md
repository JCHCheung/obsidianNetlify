## Highlights
- Part 1:
  *Defining ventricular preload*
  The conceptual definition of preload is quite straightforward: end-diastolic myocardial load/stretch. At the microscopic level, it's the sarcomere length we are interested in, which would increase with higher end-diastolic load (preload)

- 2/
  The importance of preload is in effecting the Frank-Starling mechanism: increase in ventricular performance with ⬆️ preload. The basis of F-S relationship is primarily the sarcomere Force-Length relation.
  At sarcomere length of ~2.3 μm, actin-myosin interaction is optimized.

  Any further increase in sarcomere length does not improve ventricular performance (flat part of F-S curve).
  So when we give fluids, what we're really trying to achieve is an ⬆️in the average sarcomere length.

  The clinical definition of preload is much more controversial! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Thind888/status/1277393309489672192))

  For LV, the two most commonly used measures are LVEDV and LVEDP
  Before we compare these, let's model the ventricle as a fluid-filled perfectly spherical balloon (obviously an approximation). If we fill the balloon with more fluid, it's size (LVEDV) and pressure (LVEDP) will⬆️ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Thind888/status/1277393334131097601))
- 6/
  **Pitfalls with LVEDV**
  (i) For a given LVEDV, the wall stretch (and LVEDP) would vary depending on the physical characteristics of the ventricle. E.g. 110cc is a normal adult LVEDV but would generate enormous LVEDP in kids!
  Another example is eccentric hypertrophy (in DCM). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Thind888/status/1277393417522348040))
- 7/ As new sarcomeres are added in series, the unstressed volume of LV ⬆️. So the same LVEDV would generate ⬇️LVEDP compared to normal hearts.
  (ii) Secondly, LVEDV disregards unstressed volume. E.g. in our model, balloon A has some volume (LVEDV) but its pressure (LVEDP) is zero!

  **Pitfalls of LVEDP**
  In my mind, LVEDP is a much more robust measure of LV preload and circumvents the pitfalls of LVEDV. However, a few considerations:
  (i) It's the *transmural* LVEDP that matters (more on this later)
  (ii) A given LVEDP doesn't fully describe wall stress ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Thind888/status/1277393563404382208))
- 9/ Why? Enter LaPlace's law! {T=PR/2w}
  For a given LVEDP, the amount of wall tension is dependent on the curvature of the sphere. If curvature is low (bigger sphere), same pressure causes higher wall tension.
  Here's an excellent tweetorial on this -

- 10/ *Wall stress/tension* provides the complete description of ventricular preload. Wall tension is the orthogonal stress on the LV wall that would be proportional to average sarcomere length.
  LaPlace's law states that:
  Tension (T) = (Pressure x radius) / 2.width (LV thickness)

- 11/
  Summary:
  For a *stressed LV*, preload is a function of LVEDP, LVEDV and LV thickness (w)
  Mathematically, volume is the cube root of radius, so the influence of LVEDP > LVEDV.
  Also, a thick LV (⬆️w) (e.g. HTN), would result in a lower wall stress for a given LVEDP/LVEDV. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Thind888/status/1277393729259700225))
- 12/ **Special scenario: RV**
  Here's the kicker with RV preload: normal human RV operates at or below its unstressed volume! (PMID: 27613549).
  Volume loading a normal RV initially does not invoke the F-S mechanism as its wall stress (preload) is zero! (RVEDV < unstressed volume)

- 13/ Of course, a volume overloaded RV would operate via the F-S curve.
  This under-appreciated fact has critical implications:
  (i) (Transmural) RA pressure is normally zero.
  (ii) Hence, in an unstressed RV, a CVP reading > zero reflects pericardial pressure (more on this later). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Thind888/status/1277394437967151104))
