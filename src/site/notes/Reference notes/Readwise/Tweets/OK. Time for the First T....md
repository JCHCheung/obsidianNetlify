## Highlights
- OK. Time for the first tweetorial where we‚Äôll start with the absolute basics:
  Title: The circuit and its pressures
  Level: Basic
  Author: @thind888
  Before diving right into it, an excellent primer on ECMO from @MLSCourse is well worth a read

- The figure attached shows the basic ECMO circuit. The blood flows serially through the following components:
  1)Access/drainage/venous cannula
  2)Pump
  3)Oxygenator
  4)Return/arterial cannula
  üö®Important: Circuit pressures are negative pre-pump and positive post-pump.

- ***The cannulae***: Components (1) and (4)
  The drainage and return cannulae allow a portal for blood to flow from and to the patient.
  The cannulae are wire-reinforced to prevent collapse in the presence of extreme negative pressures. This also allows curvature without kinking.

- All cannulas impose a resistance (R) to blood flow causing a pressure change (‚àÜP) across its length. The degree of ‚àÜP is governed by Poiseuille‚Äôs law
  Key things to note:
  For a given flow
  - ‚àÜP & R are inversely proportional to 4th power of radius
  - ‚àÜP & R are ‚àù to the length

- Since blood is being "sucked through" a drainage cannula, ‚àÜP across the cannula results in negative pressures at its proximal end.
  Similarly, ‚àÜP across the return cannula creates positive pressures at its proximal end.
  In general, we like these ‚àÜPs to be as low as possible.

- ***The pump***: Component 2
  Older ECMO systems used 'roller pumps'. These are still utilized in CPB & RRT systems. In these, the rollers squeeze/milk the blood through the tubing in a particular direction.
  Since these are rarely used for ECMO, we won't be discussing them further https://t.co/zPIguGxa67 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/UCSFFresnoECMO/status/1625583779996925953))
- Most modern ECMO systems utilize 'centrifugal pumps'. These contain a rotating impeller that accelerates the blood & ejects it radially
  With these, the user sets the pump speed (RPMs). The actual blood flow generated by that pump speed is dependent on several factors. https://t.co/N3LqNyTO0y ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/UCSFFresnoECMO/status/1625583782052122625))
- Important features of centrifugal pumps:
  (i) They are preload dependent:
  For a given pump speed,
  An increase in pre-pump resistance (e.g. drainage cannula occlusion) results in a drop in blood flow.
  (ii) They are afterload sensitive:
  As post-pump resistance ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, blood flow drops. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/UCSFFresnoECMO/status/1625583783960510465))
- This can be seen with return cannula occlusion or clots in the oxygenator
  (iii) They are non-occlusive:
  When the pump is stopped, retrograde flow is possible from post-pump to pre-pump side if the post-pump pressure is higher than pre-pump pressure (e.g. stopped pump in VA-ECMO) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/UCSFFresnoECMO/status/1625583785021698048))
- This is why it is taught that the circuit should never left unclamped with the pump stopped!

  Time for a breather. We will return tomorrow with part B where we‚Äôll discuss the oxygenator and various circuit pressures.
