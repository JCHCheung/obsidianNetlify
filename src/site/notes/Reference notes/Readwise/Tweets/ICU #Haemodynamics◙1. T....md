## Highlights
- ICU #haemodynamics
  1. Thoroughly enjoyable haemodynamics teaching session online last night with @katiewiskar @heart_lung @khaycock2 @ThinkingCC @chatterJ5 
  Made me dig out an old case to illustrate the most common shock scenario we encounter on ICU... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565175023353859))
- 2. 
  Middle aged patient
  Several weeks of diarrhoea, reduced intake
  Admitted with abdo pain, diarrhoea
  Intermittent SBO diagnosed
  Managed with TPN and IV fluids
  10 days later develops necrotising fasciitis
  Debrided in theatre where required vasopressors
  Sent to ICU post op ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565176755515395))
- 3. 
  Noradrenaline - moderate dose - around 0.25mcg/kg/min and vasopressin 0.04units/min
  HR 120
  MAP 56 (75/52)
  CVP 6
  CO 6.1
  SVR 650
  SV 51
  SVV 17%
  Echo - hyperdynamic
  urine output 10mls/h ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565178391363584))
- 4. 
  Patient had had around 3L per day over 10 days (combination of TPN and Hartmanns/Ringers)
  Peripheral pitting oedema
  No venous congestion ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565179972567042))
- 5. What is the likely cause of shock? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565182300385284))
- 6. What is your management? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565185274224640))
- 6.
  What we have here is a typical case of low mean systemic pressure (Pms) causing reduced venous return (VR). It's impossible to tell from the numbers above, or the echo, whether this is due to reduced volume or increased venular compliance. What can help us decide? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565186939371521))
- 7.
  a. you can't be peripherally oedematous and be hypovolaemic (unless rare circumstances). See my video lecture https://t.co/cBlvQ6q9W7
  b. we can give a challenge of fluid or vasopressors to test our hypothesis ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565188629610496))
- 8.
  A fluid challenge is given. SV and MAP ‚¨ÜÔ∏èbut 30 minutes later have returned to baseline.
  In the absence of hypovolaemia any IV fluid given will mostly leak into the tissues. What looks like an improvement will not be sustained so results in no overall benefit and possible harm ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565190382829568))
- 9. The noradrenaline was increased with the following effects:
  MAP 74 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
  CVP 6 ‚û°Ô∏è
  CO 7.1 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
  SVR 776 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
  SV 60 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
  SVV 11% ‚¨áÔ∏è ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565191934779396))
- 10. How I look at at shocked patients:
  a. Is it low Pms or the pump? - echo rules pump in or out in 5 mins
  b. If low Pms, is it a volume or compliance problem? Hypovolaemia is very unusual in ICU patientsü¶Ñ and will only be the result of GI losses or bleeding... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565193318793220))
- 11. There were GI losses in this case but the fact that input had been more than output was evidenced by peripheral oedema. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565194803695616))
- 12. If there was low Pms then how could the CO have been high? This is common in over fluid resuscitated patients on vasopressors. Unstressed volume is increased and then becomes stressed by the vasopressors allowing a high CO. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565196397531136))
- The narrow pulse pressure could easily have been interpreted as heart failure or hypovolemia. I don't find pulse pressure very useful in practice but I have friends who are cleverer than me (@khaycock2) who doü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/icmteaching/status/1638565197932527618))
