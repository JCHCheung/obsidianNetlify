## Highlights
- 1/8 - The Mystery
  It's 1981, 10 years before filgrastim is approved by the FDA.
  You're hoping to mitigate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in one of your patients.
  ðŸ¤”What medication might provide this ELEMENT of cancer care? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tony_breu/status/1636078689233281027))
- 2/8 - The Answer
  LITHIUM!
  ðŸ’¡Soon after its use for bipolar emerged, LEUKOCYTOSIS was observed to be a common side effect.

- 3/8 - The Evidence
  One 1970 report of 22 patients on lithium noted the following white blood cell counts (WBCs):
  â˜žPre-drug: 8,050
  â˜žOn lithium: 10,100
  Other series show that the WBC returns to baseline when lithium is stopped.

- 4/8 - The Mechanism
  Over the next decade, the mechanism of lithium-induced leukocytosis emerged.
  ðŸ’¡First, it became clear that lithium leads to the production of NEW neutrophils, not just redistribution of the marginated pool.

- 5/8 - The Mechanism
  ðŸ’¡Eventually we learned that lithium promotes neutrophil production by stimulating the synthesis of G-CSF.

- 6/8 - The Application
  Armed with this mechanistic understanding, the late 70s and early 80s saw trials of lithium aimed at mitigating chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
  One RCT found that lithium reduced rates of:
  â˜žNeutropenia
  â˜žFebrile neutropenia

- 7/8 - The Alternative
  Ultimately, filgrastim emerged as a more effective and safer alternative. This was demonstrated in a 1991 RCT showing reductions in neutropenic fever.
  That same year the FDA approved its use.
  And lithium faded away as an option.

- 8/8 - Postscript
  Now when I see a patient with lithium-induced leukocytosis I'll recall this story.
  In a few brief years, an observation led to basic science's search for a mechanism and clinical medicine's application of that mechanism to patients.
  So cool! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tony_breu/status/1636078735597207557))
