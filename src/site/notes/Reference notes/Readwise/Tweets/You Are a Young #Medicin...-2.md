## Highlights
- You are a young #medicine resident, you recieve a call from your surgery colleague 📞
  The patient posted for surgery has THROMBOCYTOPENIA (TCP) 😲😭
  Here's what you need to know 👇🏼

- Does the patient REALLY have TCP ?
  TCP is defined as platelet count <150k !!
  So, 149k is TCP right ?
  Yes, but get a smear to look for platelet clumps, satellitism, large platelets etc.
  The smear tells you a lot 💪🏼

- Let's enlist what one commonly finds on a BLOOD FILM !!
  Platelet clumps = pseudoTCP d/t EDTA
  Large platelets = platelet destruction
  Schistocytes = TTP/ DIC
  Blasts/ atypical cells = leukemia

- It always helps to know the TREND, the rapidity of the fall. If it's an acute fall, work up rapidly. Could be drug induced, cancer, sepsis, TTP etc.
  So, always ask for past reports !!
  Remember this 👇🏼

- Next question: Is the patient SICK ??
  If yes, think sepsis, DIC, malignancy, drug induced, TTP etc.
  About 40% of pts in ICU have TCP and the DDx is huge.
  The blood film will come to the rescue, again !!

- Always take a detailed DRUG HISTORY, including h/o alternate medication✅
  Heparin flushes for those w/ central lines- often overlooked.
  HIT is RARE, calculate 4T score. If ≥6, the probability is high and needs confirmation. STOP all heparin ASAP, screen for thrombosis!

- What we've learnt till now:
  🔸<150k is TCP
  🔸BLood smear is important
  🔸Rapidity of fall is important
  🔸Drugs are common culprits
  🔸HIT is rare, often over diagnosed
  7/12 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1587702709079068674))
- So what next, EXAMINATION !!
  Look for bleeding manifestations
  Splenomegaly
  Fever, signs of infection
  Pallor etc
  Remember, ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion, expect a normal physical ✅

- What if the patient has TCP but also THROMBOSIS 😲
  What's the ddx here ?
  🔸HIT
  🔸DIC
  🔸TTP
  🔸APLA
  DIC is the commonest of these. Check coagulation profile.
  DIC: PT/aPTT⤴️
  TTP: PT/aPTT is normal
  PLASMIC score for TTP, I've tweeted about it many a times before.

- Oh, wait !! Did I forget to tell you the patient is pregnant 🤰

- DDx of TCP in pregnancy:
  🔸Gestational TCP
  🔸ITP
  🔸HELLP
  🔸Pre-eclampsia
  🔸TTP
  🔸DIC and the rest !!
  Never think gestational TCP if platelets <50k !

- Let's summarise:
  🔸Exclude pseudoTCP (Blood film)
  🔸Drug history ✅
  🔸Clinical context (sick vs not sick)
  🔸Degree & rapidity of developing TCP
  🔸Signs of bleeding/Thrombosis
