## Highlights
- 1/5 My Dx for the e' velocity of 4 cm/s is reduced myocardial relaxation, which is sine qua non of diastolic dysfunction. It is present in all forms of myocardial disease and also with aging. Let me explain its progression & how to use the information for our pts [MayoClinicCV](https://twitter.com/MayoClinicCV)

- 25 In young healthy ‚ù§Ô∏è, medial e' is > 10cm/s and ‚¨ÜÔ∏èwhen more filling is needed with active suction at early diastole (E). With aging or myopathy, it gradually ‚¨áÔ∏è with reduced E, but atrial contraction compensates with E/A >= 7 cm/s, filling remains OK.

- 3/5 With further ‚¨áÔ∏è in relaxation ( medial e' < 7cm/s ), E ‚¨áÔ∏è & A ‚¨ÜÔ∏è with E/A < 0.8. In this Gr 1 DF, LVEDP may ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, but mean LV diastolic pressure remains normal, but potential ‚¨ÜÔ∏è in FP with exercise, HFpEF. e' does not ‚¨ÜÔ∏è much with üèå. This DF is also seen in compensated HF.

- 4/5 As LV compliance gets worse and LA pressure ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, LV diastolic pressure (LVDP) ‚¨ÜÔ∏è rapidly with ‚¨ÜÔ∏è E. Due to ‚¨ÜÔ∏è in LVDP, atrial contraction (A)contributes a little, E/A > 0.8 - 2 (Gr 2) , > 2 (Gr 3), but PV atrial reversal ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Gr 3 DF
  occurs most frequently in #amyloid or ‚¨áÔ∏è EF. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JaeKOh2/status/1799564588263833925))
- 5/5 Diastolic function assessment is critical for patient management [AJamilTajik](https://twitter.com/AJamilTajik) The best way to determine DF is to understand underlying physiology. More often than not, 2 parameters, mitral inflow and annulus velocity, are sufficient as shown below. #AIECG is also promising.
