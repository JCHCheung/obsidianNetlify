## Highlights
- #1
  https://t.co/FdjeW7ZhOI
  On the heels of the most recent study on Splanchnic Nerve Modulation, a üßµon concept behind it:
  The majority of heart failure patients are not fluid overloaded yet suffer from shortness of breath with minor activity and prior to HF decompensation

  Volume retention/overload/weight gain, is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain cardiac decompensation: Take a patient and withdraw their meds, they will have classic decompensation in front of your eyes BUT no change in weight: This was tested

  So where is intravascular blood volume sit in the body? A large portion of blood is stored in the abdomen. Liver and spleen are "sponges" full of blood. This compartment is highly innervated with sympathetic (fight or flight) fibers.

  Volume distribution from periphery/abdominal compartment to the heart/lungs is a natural process of preload augmentation that is needed to augment the cardiac output
  The veins and the so called stressed blood volume are the key players here

  Yet in heart failure, the shift of blood from the abdomen to the heart/lungs might result in more harm than benefit since the cardiopulmonary system is stiff and non compliant @JCVD https://t.co/OewlyiXZqC ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FudimMarat/status/1652248614134067201))

  We can simulate the shift of blood by stimulating the splanchnic nerve in healthy adults with rapid increase in right and left sided pressures. Pressures climb quickly BUT also drop quickly

  Stimulation of splanchnic nerves in heart failure however‚û°Ô∏èmore pronounced increase in cardiac pressures. Here again, vasoconstriction alone can explain a rise in pressures without an actual derangement in blood volume‚û°Ô∏èPressures do not equal volume

  So now the hypothesis is:
  ‚ö°Ô∏èIf Splanchnic Nerve activation could lead to cardiac decompensation
  ‚ùìCould Splanchnic Nerve blockade be a potential treatment to prevent or treat heart failure?

  Our labs newest study tried to actually trace the blood distribution at rest and exercise. Using radioplethysmography we tagged red blood cells and watched them move under a camera. As the patient exercised the blood moved towards the chest

  We blocked the splanchnic nerve with BOTOX. We saw a reduction of blood shifted towards the heart at rest and/or exercise ÔÉ† aka. increased abdominal pooling (#reversed VanDamme @JCVD)

  Further, Splanchnic Nerve Blockade resulted in a reduction in total body water and intravascular blood volume (improved renal function?) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FudimMarat/status/1652248628679913472))

  Greater splanchnic nerve (GSN) resection/ablation has been done for decades for pain reasons. The same nerve carries pain fibers and sympathetic nerve fibers. A review of historic data finds the absence of the nerve to be well tolerated

  To date there has been a series of single arm studies to demonstrate that Splanchnic Nerve Blockade can acutely result in a reduction of cardiac filling pressures

  REBALANCE HF completed enrollment. In the first phase (open-label) we found a reduction in 1m wedge pressure, improved QOL and function. This will be the largest pilot HFpEF device RCT to date. The sham-controlled part will be presented later this year

  The initial target population ‚ñ∂Ô∏è patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) given immense unmet need! 
  This population is complex and physiology is diverse
  We suspect that the two extreme phenotypes unlikely to equally benefit from the above therapy

  The aim for the REBALANCE HF pilot RCT is to help us determine the ‚ùìideal phenotype‚ùì for Splanchnic Nerve Modulation. 
  We will then embark on a pivotal RCT later this year!üåü If you are interested and want to be a site please reach out! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/FudimMarat/status/1652265507016376324))
