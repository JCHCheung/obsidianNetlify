## Highlights
- You are a young #medicine resident!
  You are working in a heavy emergency when:
  23,♂️,p/w acute breathlessness
  You check his SpO2, it's👇🏻
  You are worried and start him on supplemental 02, but he remains hypoxic😭
  Read on for the diagnosis and a brief review!

- Let's start with the causes of hypoxic that don't respond to supplemental oxygen !
  🔸R➡️L cardiac shunts
  🔸Methemoglobinemia
  🔸Sulfmethemoglobinemia
  The ABG that you sent is back!!
  It shows a normal Pa02 but your pulse oximeter is still reading 85% 🤷‍♂️
  2/20
  #MedTwitter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980202990338048))
- Your registrar is smart and he asks you to send another sample, this time asking the lab for a methemoglobin value.
  Voila !!
  The lab says: 45% methemoglobin 😮
  3/20
  #MedTwitter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980207079788545))
- Diagnosis established, registrar is a hero 🫡
  This is acute methemoglobinemia, most likely acquired, secondary to some drug/toxin 😮
  4/20
  #MedTwitter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980211995504640))
- Let's list out a few drugs/toxins you need to ask about:
  1. Primaquine
  2. Dapsone
  3. Aniline dyes
  4. Nitrites
  5. Napthalene
  6. Rasburicase
  7. Topical anesthetic
  The list is endless, any oxidant drug can l/t this !

- Our guy was given some medication for fever by his GP, most likely an antimalarial. Maybe that's the trigger !!
  It's important to know because it's to be avoided, FOREVER !!

  #MedTwitter https://t.co/5wzEdTXx2o ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980247366041601))
- You start treating him immediately ✅
  1. Continue oxygen
  2. Get an IV in place
  3. STOP THAT DRUG
  4. Send his G6PD levels !!
  Wait, G6PD !! WHY❓
  7/20
  #MedTwitter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980253410037760))
- G6PD is important here. To understand this, we need to understand the pathophysiology of metHb'emia
  MetHb = Fe++➡️Fe+++
  i.e. oxidation=loss of electron
  This Fe+++ can't deliver 02 to tissues so hypoxia develops, it's like functional anemia
  Treatment Aim: reduce it back to Fe++ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980258724241408))
- How does one convert Fe+++➡️Fe++
  You add an electron, i.e search for an electron donor !!
  In the body, an enzyme called Cytochrome B5 reductase does that. 
  So if this is ⤵️ then one can develop congenital metHb'emia or be predisposed to it at lesser dose of trigger drug!

- Another way of Fe+++➡️Fe++ is to use NADPH from the HMP shunt (uses G6PD)
  Normally this is not active in the RBC because RBC has no electron acceptor. This works only if extrinsic electron acceptor like methylene blue is present !!
  Phew 😴😴

- Ok, I'll summarise !!
  🔸MetHb is commonly drug induced
  🔸Hypoxia despite 02
  🔸Normal Pa02 but ⤵️Sp02
  🔸Cyanosis ++
  🔸Treat:
  Stop drug
  Give an electron donor to reduce Fe+++
  Don't worry, we are 👇🏻

  #MedTwitter https://t.co/YaKgKUIpd1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980294010900481))
- Coming back to the patient !
  You recieve his G6PD levels and they are within normal limits 🙏🏻
  You decide to administer methylene blue 🔵🔵🔵
  Dose: 1mg/kg IV
  Repeat dose after 1 hr if symptoms persist.
  12/20
  #MedTwitter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980299312500737))
- You can't use the ABG now to monitor his methemoglobin levels !!
  The methylene blue will cause a false + reading. Can't get into details here, DM for more if interested ! 
  So next dose only if clinically indicated, i.e. dyspnoea still present or worse.
  13/20
  #MedTwitter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980303917875200))
- What if his G6PD was ⤵️ ?
  1. The methylene blue wouldn't work
  2. The methylene blue could possibly harm him too!
  Methylene blue is an oxidant itself and in G6PD deficiency it can paradoxically cause methemoglobinemia🤷‍♂️
  We use high dose Vit C here, upto 10gm
  14/20
  #MedTwitter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980307696943104))
- Also don't use methylene blue if a patient is on an SSRI.
  There's a risk of serotonin syndrome !!
  15/20
  #MedTwitter https://t.co/kJD1OnVkUX ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980321185796097))
- This patient recieved Methylene blue x 1 dose and recovered well 👍🏻
  But did he have some predisposition to develop it in the first place ??
  Maybe some enzyme deficiency, like cytochrome B5 reductase as we spoke about earlier !
  16/20
  #MedTwitter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980326361600000))
- Maybe !!
  Heterozygous state for cytochrome b5 reductase can predispose to developing metHb with minimal exposure d/t borderline enzyme activity.
  Any little exposure might push them over the edge 👇🏻
  17/20
  #MedTwitter https://t.co/C0b8n4cSFh ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980346515193858))
- Homozygous state presents in childhood itself w/
  1. Chronic cyanosis
  2. Minimal hypoxia due to a compensatory ⤴️RBC (erythrocytosis)
  The acute management won't change so it's not so important to determine this at present. Can order an enzyme activity/NGS after recovery !
  18/20 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1617980351376420864))
- Summary slide, yeah finally 🤣
  🔸When to suspect:
  •Hypoxia despite 02
  •Unexplained cyanosis
  🔸Easy to dx on an ABG
  🔸Inherited or acquired
  🔸Detailed drug history
  🔸Treat if metHb ≥10%
  🔸Send G6PD
  🔸Start Vitamin C
  🔸Give methylene blue if normal G6PD

## Highlights
- You are a young #medicine resident !!
  A patient walks into your OPD and says he is absolutely fine but his CBC shows an ⤴️⤴️ platelet count
  He's done multiple CBC and it howers between 600-800k 😮
  He is worried about it 😕
  What do you do ??
  Read on 👇🏻👇🏻
  #MedTwitter
  1/13 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1644309901110571011))
- As always, review the smear 👇🏻
  It can give you a lot of clues !!
  You may see anything from ⤴️platelet numbers to blasts to features of iron deficiency to post-splenectomy findings on that 🙏🏻
  #MedTwitter 
  2/13 https://t.co/lvovVQGZ3W ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1644309915052417024))
- You also ask him a few things !
  1. Any erythromelalgia
  2. Any pruritis
  Palpate for a spleen, maybe get an ultrasound !
  Ask if he's ever had a thrombosis?
  As always, ask if he's on any drugs. Maybe some alcohol, cigarettes 🚬
  3/13 https://t.co/qW7iseWaKw ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1644309930089000961))
- You have another question?
  Does the level of thrombocytosis help in determining the cause?
  NO, IT DOESNT !!
  ⤴️⤴️⤴️counts ≠ CLONAL
  4/13 https://t.co/QwSSPGRU0b ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1644309945226231808))
- Let's list out the common causes of ⤴️⤴️platelets !!
  1. Iron deficiency
  2. Inflammation
  3. Trauma
  4. Infections
  5. Myocardial infarction
  6. Acute blood loss
  And obviously MPN !
  But don't jump to MPN and start sending out JAK, CALR, MPL !
  Hold your horses🏇

  5/13 https://t.co/wKBrVoDrX1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1644309961634385925))
- The first thing I do !!
  Rule out IRON DEFICIENCY. There may not always be anemia.
  The first test you send when evaluating for ⤴️platelet is ferritin 🙏🏻
  But why does iron deficiency l/t ⤴️ platelets?
  #MedTwitter

- The answer lies in the image 👇🏻
  ⤵️Iron=⤴️ commitment of the MEP towards the megakaryocyte progen=⤴️Megakaryocyte progen=⤴️platelets.
  Do read this paper to know more, it's awesome 👍🏻

- This patient might just have an iron deficiency that's causing ⤴️platelets.
  IDA might be the cause in 1/3 patients, it resolves within a couple of months of treatment of IDA.
  Don't do this👇🏻
  This guy doesn't need aspirin, he needs some iron !!

- You are embarassed, the abdominal ultrasound that you ordered is back and the SPLEEN IS MISSING😂😂
  You never asked him about the trauma he had 20yrs back, you missed the scar on examination aswell 😮
  #MedTwitter 
  9/13 https://t.co/EmOwyeatsB ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1644310022221086722))
- Another day, another patient !!
  This guy has a spleen, he isn't iron deficient, he has lost some weight over the last 6months and he says his hands BURN 🔥
  His spleen is 3cm below costal margin.
  You are sure it's an MPN 😭
  What do you do next??
  #MedTwitter 
  10/13 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1644310026859978753))
- Now you call a Hematologist 📞
  They advise you to send an MPN reflex panel
  What's that??
  That's mutation analysis of JAK2, CALR, MPL !!
  The patient has a CALR mutation !
  This is essential thrombocythemia (ET) and is best managed by a #hematologist !
  #MedTwitter
  11/13 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1644310031553396740))
- Treatment of ET isn't all about ⤵️platelet counts.
  Some need cytoreduction, some need just aspirin, some need nothing !!
  Maybe another thread to explain all of that !!
  #MedTwitter 
  12/13 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nihardesai7/status/1644310035751903232))
- Let's summarise:
  Don't be scared by ⤴️platelet counts
  Get a good history
  Get a very good blood smear
  Check if the spleen is present
  Rule out iron deficiency
  Lastly think of an MPN, this is when you involve your friendly hematologist🙏🏻
  Thanks for reading this far!
