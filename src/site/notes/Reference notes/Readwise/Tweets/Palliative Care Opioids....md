## Highlights
- Palliative care: Opioids ðŸ§µ
  Alfentanil and Fentanyl belong to the Phenylpiperidine family and have a much higher affinity for Mu opioid receptors than Morphine and Oxycodone which belong to the Phenanthrene class.
  They are more potent but this difference has other implications https://t.co/z6K5I4Huhh ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Existential_Doc/status/1588661836966428674))
- You decide to rotate a person taking 150mg of oral morphine/day to an equivalent transdermal Fentanyl patch. Their pain is stable and they are fed up taking so many pills. You do the maths and decide on a 50microgram/hour patch. https://t.co/3MvBMz3F9B ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Existential_Doc/status/1588661847766765569))
- You start the Fentanyl patch and stop the patients morphine. 
  Day 1 all is well
  Day 2 patient feeling a bit achey all over and has a headache
  Day 3 patient has diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, restlessness and feels dreadful. They are yawning and have goosebumps https://t.co/lfHKZp4ix6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Existential_Doc/status/1588661858336411648))
- They are experiencing opioid withdrawalâ€¦â€¦. But hold onâ€¦They are receiving the equivalent dose of opioid to what they had before and Fentanyl is a more potent Mu receptor agonist! 
  What is going on? https://t.co/ebEWAwjPnh ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Existential_Doc/status/1588661873544941568))
- Morphine acts on the Mu receptor and Fentanyl has that covered. 
  Morphine also acts to varying degrees on the Delta and Kappa opioid receptors which are not activated as well by Fentanyl. These receptors are not happy and withdrawal is occurring. https://t.co/Ry1cFejTlM ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Existential_Doc/status/1588661884147748864))
- Opioid receptors are concentrated in the CNS but are also found in the peripheral nerves and end organs such as the bowels. 
  Fentanyl is highly liphophilic so it rapidly dissipates into the CNS leaving those more peripheral Mu receptors a little underwhelmed. https://t.co/kYmKwLaJs2 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Existential_Doc/status/1588661899604152321))
- When you rotate from a Phenanthrene to a Phenylpiperidine too quickly you can precipitate this unpleasant seemingly paradoxical opioid withdrawal. 
  Abdominal cramps and loose stools may be main symptoms ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Existential_Doc/status/1588661903538413569))
- 2 ways to reduce the risk
  -Carry out the rotation in smaller steps over a longer period.
  -Have the original morphine or oxycodone available as an immediate release preparation to be used for pain/withdrawal
  Speak with your palliative care colleagues or pain team for advice https://t.co/3jvPWVzJ0k ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Existential_Doc/status/1588661922718941184))
- This withdrawal reaction is far less likely to happen when rotating the opposite way back to morphine or oxycodone. 
  Weird stuff ehâ€¦ really important though as opioid withdrawal is awful and can be mistaken for other/worsening illness leading to unnecessary distress https://t.co/ayNyUp6ZEf ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Existential_Doc/status/1588661933573812224))
- Opioid conversion tables and calculations are helpful but are only part of the much more complex skill that is Opioid Rotation.
  Not all opioids are equal https://t.co/vSfDilLSAy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Existential_Doc/status/1588666608687673344))
