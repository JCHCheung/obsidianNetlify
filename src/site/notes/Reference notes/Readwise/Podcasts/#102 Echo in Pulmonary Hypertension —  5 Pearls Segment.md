## Highlights
- The P a S P Estimation on the Echo is Not the Marker of Response to Treatment
  Summary:
  The estimated p a s p is actually not so bad compared to a right heart calf, which is the gold standard for measuring this value. Once pulmonary artery pressures are high, it's high and maybe this error doesn't even make that much of a difference. I consider the p s p estimation on eco to often represent what i think of as like tea short sizes,. Like small, medium, large, like were not ic here it's just how big is it? And there's no great consensus on what is mild versus moderate versus severe, exactly.

  Wow. Now that is humbling, but good reminder that no test is perfect. But when i looked into it, the estimated p a s p is actually not so bad compared to a right heart calf, which is the gold standard for measuring this value. Ye,
  Speaker 4
  at this point, there are multiple studies showing moderate correlation between the p a s p and right heart catherization numbers,
  Speaker 3
  yes. But maybe more importantly though, once pulmonary artery pressures are high, it's high, and maybe this error doesn't even make that much of a difference. I
  Speaker 1
  consider the p s p estimation on eco to often represent what i think of as like tea short sizes, like small, medium, large, like were not ic here it's just how big is it? And
  Speaker 3
  there's no great consensus on what is mild versus moderate versus severe, exactly. And what was a new teaching point for me is that it's really not that helpful to trend the p a s p on the echo. And
  Speaker 1
  so i have learned to tell the patients this in advance, because we love our patients. And they will, of course, come back to me and say, ok, dock, what was my pressure on this epo? What was my howmi do ing? What was the pressure on the echo? And then they look at you like you're insane, when the honest answer is it doesn't matter. And it's very hard for them, and and us, initially, even to accept and recognize that the prasuer estimation is not the marker of the disease, a phoenotype or characterizing it, nor is it the marker of response to treatment.

- The Right Atrium Enlarged?
  Summary:
  i am a huge fan of trending things like the internisted me. So it is hard for me not to read into changes of those palmry o pressure is too much. One thing we learn from doctor noah schonberg, a palmonologist here at b i d m c, is that it's really important in these patients to trend the r v size and function. Overtime, progressive dilitation is very concerning. It bespeaks an arv that is failing to sae for the pressures its dealing with.

  Guys,
  Speaker 2
  i got to say, i am a huge fan of trending things like the internisted me. So it is hard for me not to read into changes of those palmry o pressure is too much. Well, sha,
  Speaker 4
  it turns out you're not the only person who loves trending. One thing we learn from doctor noah schonberg, a palmonologist here at b i d m c, is that it's really important in these patients to trend the r v size and function. I
  Speaker 5
  use the eco cardeographic description of r v function as a much more detailed description of what's going on with the pulmonary circulation and the underlying pathophysiology. Overtime, progressive dilitation is very concerning. Just like progressive dilitation on the left side is very concerning. It bespeaks an arv that is failing to sae for the pressures it is dealing with. Ok?
  Speaker 3
  So what i'm getting here is the p a s p may be an initial signal of something going on, but what we should really be tracking overtime is how the arve is handling that high p a pressure,
  Speaker 4
  yes, but seeing if there's arve hypertrophes. The right atrium ([Time 0:09:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b95d532e-6144-4b7f-9eae-6ef9b1fe7fa4))
- Pulmonary Hypertension?
  Summary:
  Pretension is always going to be one of three things. Is it high flow? Is it high leftatial pressure, or is it high resistance? All elevated pulmery pressures are either due to a high flow state through that pamery system,. Two, high sited left billing pressures backing up into the palmery system, or three, high vascular resistance within that palmerysystem. So now that we know that the p s p is more or less just a signal, we then still have to figure out what's actually going on the underlying huma dynamics of comonary hi.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 4
  Yes,
  Speaker 3
  adam, i totally agree. And then i've definitely seen this as a transitional issue hen i'm seeing patients. And clinic also maybe wed repeat the echo if we didn't think they were in some udy state physiology and the p a s p is still high. So now that we know that the p s p is more or less just a signal, we then still have to figure out what's actually going on the
  Speaker 1
  underlying huma dynamics of comonary hi. Pretension is always going to be one of three things. And so i start with that concept, because when the pressure estimation is high, un echo or measured in the catlab, the real question for us is the physician, is, which of those three things is the cause and the culprit of the pressure being high?
  Speaker 2
  O o, wait a minute. One of three things. I don't abit you gays, but i feel like the five different w h o groups were hammered into my head with pulmory hypertension. Hey,
  Speaker 3
  hey, ok, so hear her out. I actually found this way of thinking of pulmonary hyper tension way more intuitive, and it's a good starting point to figure out what kind of ology our patient might have. So
  Speaker 1
  always think physiology first, and then go to the hoo groups second. So physiology first. Is it high flow? Is it high leftatial pressure, or is it high resistance? Ok,
  Speaker 2
  so to repeat those three buckets, it sounds like all elevated pulmery pressures are either due to, one, a high flow state through that pamery system. Two, high sited left billing pressures backing up into the palmery system, or three, high vascular resistance within that palmery system.
