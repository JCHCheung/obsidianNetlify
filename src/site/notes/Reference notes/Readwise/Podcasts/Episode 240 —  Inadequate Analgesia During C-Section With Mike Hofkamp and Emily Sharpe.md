  Speaker 2
  And then let me ask you. So it seems like, you know, maybe and tell me if I'm wrong here, but it seems like if this story were simple, it would be, OK, joys, group finds that general anesthesia for C-section is more dangerous than regional anesthesia. So everybody just does regional and end of story. We're better off because we're you have this lower mortality rate. But what you're saying is it's not that simple because if you have to use a ton of adjuvants to prevent general anesthesia to supplement your regional, then maybe there's risk associated with that that we need to take into account. Is that right?
  Speaker 3
