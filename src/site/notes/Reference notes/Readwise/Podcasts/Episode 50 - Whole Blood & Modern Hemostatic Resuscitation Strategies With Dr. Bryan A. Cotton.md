## Highlights
- What Is Cold Stored Versus Warm, Fresh Whole Blood?
  Summary:
  We have cold stored, number one concept, low titer, O whole blood. We don't use luke-reduced whole blood at Harbor at LAC USC. They do. And we're also looking at a study to see is there really any difference in terms of febrile reactions or transfusion related complications.

  For our listeners, I think one of the things we need to break down and I know for us when I first started using whole blood, I couldn't wrap my head around it. And you've already alluded to the fact that in the past, people were advocating for type specific whole blood. Now we're just giving O whole blood, whether it's negative or positive. So let's break it down. So we have cold stored, number one concept, low titer, O whole blood. And sometimes it's either luke-reduced or not. We don't use luke-reduced whole blood at Harbor at LAC USC. They do. And we're also looking at a study to see is there really any difference in terms of febrile reactions, any sort of transfusion related complications, so more data to follow.

  But let's break that down. So cold stored versus warm, fresh whole blood. Yeah, warm, fresh old blood. I mean, you're talking about literally taking it straight from the patient in a military setting for the most part. Because again, you're civilian setting. There's just a little bit too much more bureaucracy rather than in a deployed setting. And the warm whole blood, there's no any temperature damage. If there is any, there's no temperature damage that's being caused. And you're getting it literally straight from that patient.
