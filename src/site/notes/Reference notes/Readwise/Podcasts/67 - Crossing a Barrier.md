## Highlights
- The Effect of Dexamethasone on Endothelial Cell Leakage
  Key takeaways:
  - Dexamethasone may have a noninflammatory effect on endothelial cells,.
  - Dexamethasone may upregulate tight junction proteins.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  As I envision a tissue culture plate, I can't imagine there is a tremendous inflammatory response that's going on there that needs to be blunted. So this experiment sounds like a decidedly non-anti-inflammatory effect. Am I getting that right?
  Speaker 1
  Absolutely. And reflecting on this experiment is so elegant because they essentially isolated the endothelial cells from the immune system. So this cannot be an immune response mediating this mechanism. And it's a really elegant way to try to see if there's something else going on. And they found that dexamethasone is doing something to the endothelial cells to make them less leaky.
  Speaker 3
  Does it have to do with the tight junctions that we talked about before? It has floored by this, but it turns out there's evidence to suggest that dexamethasone actually does upregulate tight junction proteins.
  Speaker 1
  So the same 2003 rat endothelial study found that when those rat endothelial cells were exposed to dexamethasone, they increased the expression of tight junction proteins, including ZO1 and occludin. ([TimeÂ 0:12:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/669f886c-f212-4a96-8f55-9c617773e293))
