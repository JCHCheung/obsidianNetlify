## Highlights
- Sephopine
  Summary:
  This is one of those diagnoses that you just have to consider and not forget about. Because da six of sephopine therapy, patient gets confused. It actually could be the drug. And so your timing of drug initiation vorsu symptom onset is important,. There are apparently some certain e e g, or electro encephlogram patterns that can be consistent with the drug related incephilopathy.

  And
  Speaker 1
  we probablyshould have invited a neurologist on to this episode, am pote pharmasis, and a pharmacist and an infectious disease osr um. But i think this is one of those diagnoses that you just have to consider and not forget about. Because da six of sephopine therapy, patient gets confused. It actually could be the drug. And so your timing of drug initiation vorsu symptom onset is important, like any drug toxicity. And there actually are apparently some certain e e g, or electro encephlogram patterns that can be consistent with the drug related incephilopathy, such as triphasic waves or non convulsive status epilepticus. I think if those were to be occurring in a patient on the smetication, that should raise concern. But at the same time, you don't want to anchor on this diagnosis either, right? Like you don't want to miss like, primary nerological pathologies either. So it is very challenging. So
  Speaker 3
  when must sapapim nerotax ity, this idea that this was an effect of the drug first described, like, how did people figure figure it out? Initially as a clinical entity
  Speaker 1
  way back in 19 99. So actually not that long ago was when the first report of an associated neurotocicity with sepapine was reported. And it was published as letter in the journal nephrology dialysis transplantation. ([Time 0:04:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/980c226a-34aa-408d-8156-f061c74f2d36))
- Sephopine Sepsis
  Summary:
  All betalactim tics, including sephalus porins and penecilons and carbopetums, can cause neurotoxicity. So it really does seem to be a class of fect thet's probably an important initial clue. also that they, like, got access to high performance liquid chromitography quick enough to use in a clitical setting"

  Speaker 3
  incredible. And also that they, like, got access to high performance liquid chromitography quick enough to use in a clitical setting and like optimized dd and like, these must have been somea incredible set of scientist, glanitians in the fant that
  Speaker 2
  they, they even considered it so much that they went looking for the luquid cromotography, that that's like good on them.
  Speaker 3
  So it's true. So they must have known somehow that there might be a pathologic mechanism behind this. So what is it? What's the proposed mechanism that might have made them think to say that this was the sapopee?
  Speaker 1
  One important clue is that the ability for anabotics to induce nerotoxicity is not actually unique to sephopine, particularly for seizures. Even though sephopi may be one of the more, is probably on of the more common offenders. I certainly remember learning about carbopenimind seizures even in med school. But it turns out that, like we talked about at the beginning, all betalactim tics, including sephalus porins and penecilons and carbopetums, can cause neurotoxicity. So it really does seem to be a class of fect thet's probably an important initial clue. ([Time 0:06:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d423e7c0-8c98-4794-bbcd-62b62b76b550))
- Betalactem Anabotics Cause Seizures
  Summary:
  All betalactim tics, including sephalus porins and penecilons and carbopetums, can cause neurotoxicity. A 19 71 study in cats implicated the batal act hammering specifically as a source of neurot toxicity with these types of annibiotic.

  Speaker 2
  what is it about betalactem anabotics that leads to this neurotoxicity, specifically this idea of seizures? It
  Speaker 1
  turns out the answer is in the name bata actium. So remember that all types of betalactium. Anabotics have batalactium rings as part of their structurest very creative naming that we have. But, you know, sephapim and sephizolon seem to be the most sort of caesarogenic, and piprcilon and sep xim are sort of on the lesser end of that spectrum and less caesur inducing. But a 19 71 study in cats implicated the batal act hammering specifically as a source of neurotoxicity with these types of annibiotic. And essentially the what they did was they connected the cats to amonitor brain activity while giving them high doses of panacellon which those hihdoses induced ([Time 0:06:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/81b7737b-0dfb-44b3-a572-02787d88a7f8))

And essentially the what they did was they connected the cats to amonitor brain activity while giving them high doses of panacellon which those hihdoses induced seizures. But when they administered the ensyme batalactimis, which degrades betalactam rings, the cats were protected from getting seizures induced by penicilon. So something about breaking down the batalactam ring blocked penisin's ability to cause neuritoxicity. O
  Speaker 3
  so we think that the batalactam ring component of the structure is the thing that's causing the neuro toxicity. But, but why? Why would, why would a batalactam ring affect the brain.
  Speaker 1
  Well, it turns out that cephalu sporns, in particular, block the binding of the inhibitory ner transmitter, gaba, minobeteric acid, better known as gaba, to its receptor in the brain. And this was demonstrated with sepizolin in rats in a study from 19 85, where the researchers found that it actually physically, the sephasolon physically blocked the gaba receptor. And it actually did so in a concentration dependent manner. So the more sepizolon was present, the more the gaba receptor was blocked. And so presumably the same is applying with epapim and that's what it's doing. ([Time 0:07:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/944a6592-0377-4b38-93a9-f92314ec7358))
- Sepsis in Renal Failure
  Summary:
  A study an 20 18, looked at sephopis ability to induce seizures in rat brains. The rat nerons surrounded by higher potassium levels had more seizures after sephopime exposure than the brains surrounded by normal potassium. And it seems like the metabolic milu in renal failure may matter as well.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes,
  Speaker 3
  think ot for our pharmacy colleagues who ow it, who help us appropriately dose medications like suf of peam, scant, i feel, be a little bit tricky sometimes with communicating the dosing, because it's not always clear if you're wanting to do the higher dose for pseudamonial coverage, which i think can sort of lead some challenges therewith making sure that you then dont suggest to that point though, is it just aki increase drug levels? Is just, surely the quantity in renal failure? So
  Speaker 1
  there's one more wrinkle to the story. And it seems like the metabolic milu in renal failure. Patience may matter as well. And so a study an 20 18, looked at sephopis ability to induce seizures in rat brains. And the authors bathed the brains in a hyper calemic medium and a normal calemic medium, so high potassium and normal potassium levels, and then they exposed both to sephopine. And the rat nerons surrounded by higher potassium levels had more seizures after sephopime exposure than the brains surrounded by normal potassium.

- Sepopin Can Induce Neurotoxicity By Blocking The Gabera Sceptre
  Summary:
  This is a one of those topics that is fascinating, but also so relevant to the kind of patients i care for. I feel like half my patients arons ave bean, and the other half are insephalo hic a lashy. And you know, so sepopin can induce nerotoxicity by blocking the gabera sceptre - similar to how other batal actium anabotics can induce neurot toxicity. But hyper calemia probably also predisposes to sepapi indrs nertoxt, incredible. The reality is this is a class effect with other betalactam anibiotics. Renal failure is the main wrist factor, because of decreased clearance
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  I feel like that clinical syndrome of my aclonic jerking to me ever since i saw a case of saphopem nerotoxicity, just like always in a patient with renal disfunction, n an particularly bad renal disfunction, just always triggers for me immediately, what is the drug effect going on here? Something sort of like unique about it.
  Speaker 2
  This is a one of those topics that is fascinating, but also so relevant to the kind of patients i care for. I feel like half my patients arons ave bean, and the other half are insephalo hic a lashy. There's got to be some overlap so et yet they're not mutually exclusive. Anyway, there's a lot of patients on semons, a lot of patients whoare incyphlopathic. So this, i think, is supremely relevant. So i'm really, really glad that we talked about it. But you got to have some takehome points for us. What a, you got i
  Speaker 1
  do? And you know, so sepopin can induce nerotoxicity by blocking the gabera sceptre, similar to how other batal actium anabotics can induce neurotoxicity, particularly seizures, but also in cephilopathy, miclonos tremors. And this likely results from structural similarities between gaba and the batal actim ring, which is sort of wild, in my opinion, that they look like each other. And the reality is this is a class effect with other betalactam anibiotics. Renal failure is the main wrist factor, because of decreased clearance, increased serum drug levels. That leads to more blockade of gaber ceptors. But hyper calemia probably also predisposes to sepapi indrs nertoxt, incredible.
