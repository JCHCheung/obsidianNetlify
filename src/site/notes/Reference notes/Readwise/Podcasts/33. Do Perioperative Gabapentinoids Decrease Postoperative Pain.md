## Highlights
- The Effect of Pre-Gabilant on Pain Scores in Patients Undergoing Surgery
  Key takeaways:
  (* Pregabilant has been shown to be effective in reducing pain scores at 2 hours after surgery., * This effect is statistically significant.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Of the total 4,155 patients, about 55%, which is 2,270, received pre-gabilant in the other 45%, or 1,885 patients served as controls. For the different dosing regimens, the authors looked at subgroup analysis at 2 hours and at 24 hours. At 2 hours, they looked at the individual doses of pre-gabilant given before surgery, so this was either less than or equal to 75, between 100 and 150 or 300 milligrams. And at 24 hours, they looked at the dose and frequency for the same three dose levels, as well as single versus multiple dosing at each dose level. I won't go too much into detail on the subgroup analyses for pain scores, but as usual, I'll provide a citation to the manuscript, and fortunately it's also an open access article. So let's talk about the primary outcomes. In terms of pain scores at 2 hours, pool results showed a statistically significant reduction in pain scores at rest and during movement with a mean difference of negative 0.81 and negative 0.94 respectively. All VAS scores were converted to a 0 to 10 scale, by the way. ([TimeÂ 0:05:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a933d02d-ab15-4b09-91df-8d118b78e4bd))
