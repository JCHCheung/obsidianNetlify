## Highlights
- Met Foreman and Lactic Acedosis
  Summary:
  Met foreman actually has a very low rate of lactic acedosis, about five cases per 100 thousand patients. The proposed mechanism for elevated lactate with met foreman is inhibition of glucon genesis and mito condrial impairment. Should be considered in patiencs on met foreman with kidney failure, liver failure or overdose.

  Met foreman actually has a very low rate of lactic acedosis, about five cases per 100 thousand patients. This is similar to the rate diabetic patients not receiving metforeman would experience lactic acedosis. However, one of the precursor medications to metforeman. Fen foreman was associated with a high incident of elevated lactate that was accompanied by a high mortality rate. Whether or not met foreman causes lactic acedosis is still controversial. And a major cockran metaanalysis concluded that there was no increased risk of the development of elevated lactate for met foreman compared to non met forman treatment. The proposed mechanism for elevated lactate with met foreman is inhibition of glucon genesis and mito condrial impairment. Met foreman induce lactic acedosis. Should be considered in patiencs on met foreman with kidney failure, liver failure or overdose. The treatment is support of care, and in cases of renal insufficiency, hemodiasis, which will correct the metabolic acidosis and remove excess metforman. Lactic acedosis is a complication of liver damage from ecedameipen overdose. However, it can also be the result of the accumulation of acetamenipin, metablates in chronic ingestion, even at a therapeutic ([Time 0:01:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b05220b8-da97-41a0-b00f-27c6e06e1491))
- Lactic Acidosis
  Summary:
  Lactic acidosis is a complication of liver damage from ecedameipen overdose. Should be considered in patiencs on met foreman with kidney failure, liver failure or overdose. Linasled may cause lactic acidosis from an interaction between the drug and mita condrial ribosomes. The likely patient to experience this is elderly with multiple comorbidities.

And i have a case report linked in the show notes to this effect the likely patient to experience this is elderly with multiple comorbidities, unless due to liver damage, the lactic acidosis should resolve quickly with cessation of a seta menaphin and administration of ivy fluid. Linasled may cause lactic acidosis from an interaction between the drug and mita condrial ribosomes. If linased inhibits mita condrial protein synthesis, erobic energy production is limited, and anerobic lycolysis and lactae generation occurs. This is typically only a concern with prolonged therapy.

Treatment involves withdrawing the drug and support of care. And finally, lacti acidosis from theaphalin is usually associated just with overdose. However, lactic aced doses may also occur with therapeutic doses of theaphalin. Hemodialysis should be considered for severe cases. Otherwise, treatment involves just withdrawing the drug and support of care. You can access my free download area with 19 different resources for hospital pharmacis at pharmacy jo dot com slash free.
