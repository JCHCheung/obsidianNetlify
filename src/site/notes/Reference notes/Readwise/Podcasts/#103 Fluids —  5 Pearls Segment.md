## Highlights
- What Makes Up a Fluid?
  Summary:
  There are three main categories. There are fluids that distribute all the water in the body, fluids that go just to the extra cellular space, and some fluids that just stay completely in the blood vessels. Ineffective osmols don't easily cross the brane so they can pull fluid from one space to another. An example of an effective osmal would be as something like sodium a glucos potassium,. or as an. eurea that can cut af move freely across a semi permebal membrane.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  That was my reaction too. I definitely did not understand that before working on this episode. But will go through it step by step, i think, to really understand this concept we first need to remind ourselves about all the places that fluid can go in the body. Oh boy. To keep things simple, we really have three main categories. There are fluids that distribute all the water in the body, fluids that go just to the extra cellular space, and some fluids that just stay completely in the blood vessels. Ok,
  Speaker 1
  ok. So then how do we know which fluids are the ones that go all over the body and which theone ta just stay in that extra cellular space? Yes,
  Speaker 2
  that's where we need to think about osmolality and tenicity. So the way i think about it is that all this stuff in a fluid makes up the osmolality, but only some of that stuff are effective osmols. And what makes them effective osmols is that they don't easily cross the brane, so they can pull fluid from one space to another. Tenicity
  Speaker 5
  is essentially the effective osmalality. And so an example of an effective osmal would be as something like sodium a glucos potassium, or as an. Ineffective osmal would be something like eurea that can cut af move freely across a semi permebal membrane. Oh,
  Speaker 1
  so i guess the biggest take away here is that when we're choosing a fluid, you need to know what actually makes up the fluid. And i think people can easily mistake thinking, ok, well, i know the osma lality of the ([Time 0:04:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/661d331d-dbb1-43ed-bf79-e493ac66f018))
- How Much Sugar Is That?
  Summary:
  D fie w is 50 grams of glucose mixed in a or dextrous, into one leter. A snicker's candy bar has 20 grams of sugar. Half the patients on my list have di bet. I feel like you've probably caught one or two ricky mistakes there. It wer tur oot tha te really been there. Reat.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 4
  Fascinating.
  Speaker 1
  So it all comes back to that tenisy. And sounds like sugar is basic a temporary effective ozma, like a temporary wing woman or a wing man, tryig to yet trying to keep the water inside and keep the red cells from bursting,
  Speaker 2
  absolutely. And i do think it's good to remember that the important part of d five w is the water, not the d five, right? The d five is just as that temporary wing man or wing woman, as you said. So, you know, we me're tryg to fix hyperna tremia. Sometimes on rounds we'll talk in shorthand and just say, start them on a d five trip. But just make sure you're actually ordering d five w. If you order something else like d five n s, that's just sailing with some added sugar. There's no free water.
  Speaker 1
  I feel like you've probably caught one or two ricky mistakes there. It wer tur oot tha te really been there. He oh. Reat. So going back to that 50 grams of dextros, how much sugar is that? I mean, half the patients on my list have di bet. So help me put this into context. D
  Speaker 4
  fie w, i mean, it is 50 grams of glucose mixed in a or dextrous, into one leter. Ah, so how how many grams does a snicker's candy bar have of sugar? 20 grams. I mean, this is more than a candy bar, ok? ([Time 0:12:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e3980763-5259-4cca-a7f4-b171a3365332))
- The Knock On Normal Sailing
  Summary:
  An excess of chloride creates a state a non gat metabolic acidosis. And obviously, any state of acidosi is not good for an ailing patient. The kidney really regulates its g f r based on flow. So if the kidney is seeing really high flow, it'll turn down g f r. If the kidney sees low flow, it'd try to turn up the g f r and that's what happens in septic patients.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The knock on normal sailing has been this idea
  Speaker 3
  that im giving too much of it can create this hyper chloremic metabolic acidosis. But basically the way to think about it is that an excess of chloride creates a state a non gat metabolic acidosis. And obviously, any state of acidosi is not good for an ailing patient, specially a critically ill ailing patient. And we've all seen it. We've all seen giving a large amount of normal sailing to a patient, and inevitably they end up with the chloride. And like the high 100, low onteens and thei bicarb drops, un like the 15 16 range.
  Speaker 1
  I have seen too many of those basic metabolic panels.
  Speaker 2
  Yes. Now, i think another interesting thing to point out is that the kidney really regulates its g f r based on flow. So if the kidney is seeing really high flow, it'll turn down g f r. And if the kidney sees low flow, it'll try to turn up the g f r. And what's interest thing is that the way the kidney actually sends this flow, funny enough, is by chloride delivery. So if the kidney is seeing a lot of chloride, it thinks the flow is really high, and it'll turn down the g f rso just think about that for a second. If you think about a septic patient whose kidney is already at risk, that really high chloride basically tricks kidney into dropping its own g f r. And ina vulnerable kidney, that could be enough to push it into ac and
  Speaker 4
  so one of the mechanisms that is called tub glamalar feedback. And so in the macula densa, whenever you have increasing levels of chloride, it then turns to the glamarius and shuts down in clamps the aparnt nefair material. So you do not make any more. Your g f r goes down to zero. Don't make any more filtrate. ([Time 0:25:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/34ce48f0-f5b1-4c89-b9a3-87b77439fb08))

- Red Blood Cell Transfusions Can Be Great for Resuscitation
  Summary:
  Red blood cell trans fusions can be great for resuscitation because they stay almost completely in the inter vascular space. But when we compare red blood cells to proteins like albumen, red blood cells actually don't exert any n pressure, so they don't draw in any additional fluid from the interesticion. The whole 300 c cs from a union of blood stays intervascularly, verses about 250 c CS from a leader of l r.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Really interesting to think about that. I think thing about blood is, i often have heard people talk about blood as a colloid. I am curious, you know, does blood draw any extra fluid from the intercistion, the way colloids like albumen do? And
  Speaker 3
  i think that the the question then is, will the paced red bloodcell infusion actually attract more water into the intervassular space? And i don't think that necessarily is true, but the reality is that, in comparison to the sort of oncotic pressure over all the the effect of pactrid blutzels is actually relatively small because of the mana particles. So this was definitely
  Speaker 2
  in point for me. I always assumed that red blood cells also acted as a colloid and had ancotic pressure to draw on more fluid yen.
  Speaker 1
  I think another way to put it, it seems like, is proteins like albumen exert ancotic pressure, cells like inparbises, don't pull in any water. So
  Speaker 2
  just to summarize this quick pearl, red blood cell trans fusions can be great for resuscitation because they stay almost completely in the inter vascular space. The whole 300 c cs from a union of blood stays intervascularly, verses about 250 c cs from a leader of l r. Right?
  Speaker 1
