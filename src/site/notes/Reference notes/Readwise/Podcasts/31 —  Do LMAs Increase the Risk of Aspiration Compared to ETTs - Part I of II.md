## Highlights
- oesophogi illumines and Oesophageal Aspiration
  Summary:
  The comme tube, easy tube and intimating elema fast tracts each withstood water pressures in the oesophagus. The laryngilomatic airway pro seal, the laryngial tube and the larygial tube, l t s two were each able to block the phagus. Two the classic eleme fell in its own category. It was slightly less effective at blocking esophogial pressures. But really only minor leakage was observed in the trachea in patients that were intumated with the classic Eleme.

  in their results, they noticed that these different airy devices really fell under three categories. First, the comme tube, easy tube and intimating elema fast tracts, each withstood water pressures in the oesophagus to a hundred and 15 centimeters of water in the case of the intibating eleme, a hundred and 20 centimeters of water in the case of the easy tube, and a hundred and 25 centimeters of water in the case of the come tube. Conversely, the laryngilomatic airway pro seal, the laryngial tube and the laryngial tube, l t s two were each able to block the phagus. Up to mean pressures of 71 centimeters of water in the case of the pro seal, 70 centometers of water in the case of the larential tube, and 74 contimeters of water in the case of the l t s. Two the classic eleme fell in its own category. It was slightly less effective at blocking esophogial pressures. It lost its seal around forty eight centimeters of water. But really only minor leakage was observed in the trachea in patients that were intumated with the classic eleme. And the authors felt that this was because the elma actually created the protective seal over the trachea, preventing any regurgitated sophageal contents from translating into any kind ofpir so
  Speaker 2
  in essence, they simulated an increase in oesophogia pressure and evaluated the ability of various super glotic airways to seal the oesophagus. I do want to point out that a couple of devices, specifically the comba tube, easy tube, pro seal ma and l t s, all had osophogi illumines which were also tested. Now, when opened, these lumns were able to effectively drain fluid, which is another feature to these alames. As chris will talk a bit more in his takeaways. Even the authors are not ultimately clear about how to put these results into clirical perspective. Here's chris,
  Speaker 1
  one main takeaway is thatle age from as ovigial reflux is not synonymous with trachial aspiration. There are actually separate entities entirely. And int the latter one pulmontary aspiration, which we care about clinically and has more clinical significance in terms of leading to clinical complications for the patient.

- Meta-Analysis of Pulmonary Aspiration With Alamas
  Summary:
  The first large meda analysis that was actually performed was done by brimicombe and barry in 19 95. Here they included a hundred and one different publications for a total of 12 thousand, 901 patient cases. In their results, the authors identified only three cases of aspiration in the entire sudy population,. This translates to an incidence rate of two point three per ten thousand patient cases. And this was across all published literature up until septem 19 93.

  Speaker 1
  I think one of the challenges of these earlier studies is that they were published either in smaller patient populations or that were not performed in a real clinical setting, as in the case of these cadaverou studies. So this first large meda analysis that was actually performed was done by brimicombe and barry in 19 95, and it was publshd ine journal of clinical anaesthesia. Here they included a hundred and one different publications for a total of 12 thousand, 901 patient cases. These pubs were primarily observational in nature, and they looked at the eleme as the primary are management technique. And the majority of the patients in these studies had their airways maintained via spontaneous ventilation. And that came out to be 52 point six % versus 19 point four % of patients who were maintained using intermittent positive pressure ventilation, and 28 % who were maintained with some form of mixed or unspent, unspecified ventilatory modes. In their results, the authors identified only three cases of aspiration in the entire sudy population, out of all 12 thousand 901 patients. This translates to an incidence rate of two point three per ten thousand patient cases. And they define aspiration pretty rigorously as either the presence of bilious secretions in the trachio bronchial tree, bronkoskipy, or if bronkoskipy was not performed by post operative chest radiography, with the identification of infiltrates. On top of that, of the three cases of aspiration that were seen in the study, the author saw predisposing factors in two of those three cases. In one of them, it was an emergencycas and in the second case, the patient was placed in trendellenberg with intra abdominal insuflation.
  Speaker 2
  So with this metaanalysis, the authors were able to calculate a final incidente of pulminary aspiration with alamas at about two in ten thousand. And this was across all published literature up until septem 19 93. ([Time 0:22:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/19bd128d-e31c-44db-b2b2-0653a723cb3c))
- Is There a Clinical Relevance of Aspiration?
  Summary:
  This study aimed to look at the overall incidents of airway complications during and after general anetesa in patents who were using flexible eleme versus andetracal tubes for airway management. The relative risk was calculated as point seven, six, with a 95 % confidence interval of point o 6 to eight.

  Speaker 1
  This study aimed to look at the overall incidents of airway complications during and after general anetesa in patents who were using the flexible eleme versus andetracal tubes for airway management. The study was comprised primarily of randomized control trials. The procedures that were included were primarily involving the head neck. In the end, out of all the studies they reviewed, they ended up including ten random ized control trials for a total of 996 different participants. Unfortunately, the incidenc of aspiration was investigated in only two of those ten studies. And in terms of the pooled incidents of aspiration with an elma versus enatraca tube, the rates were very similar. The relative risk was calculated as point seven, six, with a 95 % confidence interval of point o six to eight. Point eight eight. Regarding some of the other outcomes of this study, the flexible elema was found to have a lower incidenc of hoarseness, coughing and saturations when compared to the anitracal tube. And each of those results was statistically significant. So my overall takeaway when i looked at the study was that although the incidence of aspiration was similar between both groups, the conclusion was a little bit limited because only two subjects in either of the studies were analyzed, and the criteria and the methods that were used diagnose aspiration also differet between the two studies.

- The Rule of Three
  Summary:
  Of the 23 events reported, only 13 occurred during maintenance. Bryan shared some of his thoughts on the in statistical analysis. The rule of three states that if a certain event did not occur in a sample with n subjects, then the interval from zero to three over n represents a 95 % confidence interval for the rate of occurrences in the general population.

  commentary here actually prompted me to revisit the nap for report. In chapter 19, there 's a summary focusing specifically on aspiration. And in table two, they provide some information as relates to timing of primary aspiration. Of the 23 events reported, only 13 occurred during maintenance. And the remainder actually occurred either before or during airway management or during emergence itself, which i think lends further credence to doctor gleeron's observations. Before we wrapped up this episode, i want touch on a concept that was brought up to me by doctor keith baker, and that is the statistical concept of the rule of three. This is especially relevant when it comes to literature like this, where the incident of our target outcome is particularly low. Bryan shared some of his thoughts on the in

- The Rule of Three
  Summary:
  Of the 23 events reported, only 13 occurred during maintenance. Bryan shared some of his thoughts on the in statistical analysis. If a pain relief drug is tested on 15 hundred human subjects and no adverse event is recorded, we can conclude with 95 % confidence that fewer than one person in 500, or three in 15 hundred, will experience an adverse event.

The rule of three states that if a certain event did not occur in a sample with n subjects, then the interval from zero to three over n represents a 95 % confidence interval for the rate of occurrences in the general population. To illustrate, suppose a pain relief drug is tested on 15 hundred human subjects and no adverse event is recorded. From this rule of three, we can conclude with 95 % confidence that fewer than one person in 500, or three in 15 hundred, will experience an adverse event. Imp ly, the premise here is that the incident is not zero. Zero is the number we recorded. But there is some statistical uncertainty that surrounds that value.

- Is the Drug Safe?
  Summary:
  The rule of three is a very handy formula for determining how much confidence we should have that nothing will go wrong after no events occur in some number of consecutive patients. Using this rule, we can say that, if no events occurs in n consecutive patients, we can have 95 % confidence that the actual rate of an unfavorableout is less than three in n.

  You know,
  Speaker 2
  i actually thought this concept was so important to this episode that i actually also reachd out to do baker to get some of his additional perspectives on the topic. So here's doctor baker talking a little bit more about the rule of three. I
  Speaker 4
  think most of us can think of situations in medicine when nothing goes wrong after doing a number of procedures or after using a drug a number of times. For example, let's imagine you've recently used a drug on 60 consecutive patients and no untoward events occur. Does this mean the drug is safe? Of course not, because the number of patients, 60, is too low to have much confidence that nothing will go wrong in the future. The rule of three is a very handy formula for determining how much confidence we should have that nothing will go wrong after no events occur in some number of consecutive patients. Using this rule, we can say that, if no events occur in n consecutive patients, we can have 95 % confidence that the actual rate of an unfavorableout is less than three in n.

The rule of three should really only be used when events are independent of each other and when the sample size is greater than 30.

  think most of us can think of situations in medicine when nothing goes wrong after doing a number of procedures or after using a drug a number of times. For example, let's imagine you've recently used a drug on 60 consecutive patients and no untoward events occur. Does this mean the drug is safe? Of course not, because the number of patients, 60, is too low to have much confidence that nothing will go wrong in the future. The rule of three is a very handy formula for determining how much confidence we should have that nothing will go wrong after no events occur in some number of consecutive patients. Using this rule, we can say that, if no events occur in n consecutive patients, we can have 95 % confidence that the actual rate of an unfavorableout is less than three in n. So going back to our example, if we had had zero negative events in 60 patients, then we can say with 95 % confidence that the rate of adverse events is less than three in 60. This rate can also be calculated as one in the number of patients divided by three, which is less than one and 20 patients, or less than five % of patients in this example. So far, from having no negative complications, we now know with 95 % confidence that the rate of an event is less than five %, which means that there is still a real possibility that the drug be safe. The rule of three should really only be used when events are independent of each other and when the sample size is greater than 30.
