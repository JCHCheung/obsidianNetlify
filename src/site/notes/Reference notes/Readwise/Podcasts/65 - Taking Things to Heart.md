## Highlights
- Molecular Mimicry and the Effects of Rheumatic Fever
  Key takeaways:
  (* Rheumatic fever can cause damage to the heart valves, and this damage can lead to heart failure., * Molecular mimicry is a mechanism by which the heart valves and antigens on strep pyogenes can be mistaken for each other, and this can lead to damage.)

  But you know, mitral stenosis from rheumatic heart disease is not subtle when it gets severe. And so I imagine many of these patients were severe. But to your point, it also suggests that this is maybe an underestimate. There may be people who had rheumatic heart disease that didn't have heart failure as a result of it, but wouldn't have ended up being captured. But you know, but I find this study compelling and it does seem like rheumatic fever in some way causes valvular damage, mitral more than aortic. So what's the mechanism?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, so that brings us back to our original question, right? So the answer, it centers on two domains. The first is the concept of molecular mimicry. And the second is the notion that there are pressure gradients between the left atrium and ventricle. And ultimately the answer is probably going to be some combination of these two ideologies, but that's what we're here to unpack. Huh.
  Speaker 2
  All right, well, they both sound interesting. Which one should we tackle first?
  Speaker 1
  You know, let's probably do molecular mimicry first, just because it's sort of, it's chewy. There's a lot of layers to this one. And just molecular mimicry is sort of fun to say. This involves the idea that two otherwise completely different factors or epitopes or antigens look similar to each other structurally. And they can sort of be mistaken one for the other by the body. And as we'll see, that can have some untoward effects. So as it turns out, there can be molecular mimicry between heart valves and antigens on strep pyogenes.
  Speaker 3
  Yeah, so if the idea that rheumatic fever would ultimately affect the heart ([Time 0:06:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/06c0ee04-257a-4dc8-894b-f8ca528eca7a))
- The Role of Molecular Mimicry in the Development of Rheumatic Heart Disease
  Key takeaways:
  (* Molecular mimicry is one of the main mechanisms of rheumatic heart disease, and valvular involvement is really common, but myosin probably can't fully explain it.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Okay, so there's a molecular mimicry between this M protein and cardiac myosin after an untreated group A-strap infection. And this leads the body to make auto-on antibodies against cardiac myosin. Is that first part right? Yeah. Okay. And so this leads to some immune-mediated attack of the cardiac tissue, and ultimately, years, maybe even decades later, rheumatic heart disease. So the assumption is that this all helps to ultimately explain the valvular involvement more specifically. Is that right?
  Speaker 1
  Well, you'd think so, but it's not entirely correct. So you know, rheumatic heart disease can manifest in different ways besides valvular involvement. There can be myocarditis or myopericarditis, pericarditis. And I'm guessing that the myosin molecular mimicry part is probably at play there, at least partially, but it doesn't actually explain the heart valve association. And that's because cardiac valves don't contain any myosin. They have fibrous connective tissue like elastin. They have endocardium, but they don't contain any myosin. And we know that molecular mimicry is one of the main mechanisms of rheumatic heart disease, and valvular involvement is really common, but myosin probably can't fully explain it.
  Speaker 2
  That is so interesting because I think this is one of those things that the furthest that med school goes basically in teaching you about this is like molecular mimicry and protein myosin. ([Time 0:10:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ecce2ac6-17ac-4274-82ca-54c59a9eb553))
- Streptococcal Molecular Mimicry and the Impact on Cardiac Valve Disease
  Key takeaways:
  (* Laminin and myosin share structural similarities, which is why there is evidence that laminin contributes to rheumatic heart disease and valvular involvement., * Laminin was found to be a target of anti-eustreptococcal myosin antibodies, which suggests that molecular mimicry may play a role in the damage caused by these antibodies., * Further evidence of the role of molecular mimicry in laminin-heart valve damage was found in a study where laminin was detected in the basement membranes of formal and fixed mitral valves.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Laminin is a protein found in basement membranes and cardiac valves contain a lot of laminin. And as it happens, laminin has structural similarities to myosin. They sort of look like each other, so it's not surprising that there's evidence that laminin also plays a role in rheumatic heart disease and contributes to this valvular involvement. There was a 2000 study from the Journal of Clinical Investigation that collected and analyzed the serum from a rheumatic heart disease patient and found that this patient had made antibodies that reacted against M protein and cardiac myosin, which is not surprising based on what we've discussed, but they also found that the same antibody targeting M protein and myosin also reacted strongly to laminin. So this suggested that laminin and myosin are similar enough that molecular mimicry also plays a role for the laminin in damaging heart valves in the setting of rheumatic heart disease.
  Speaker 2
  And do we have any histological evidence that the laminin and the heart valves is actually impacted by these antibodies?
  Speaker 1
  So that same 2000 JCI study found that this anti-eustreptococcal myosin antibody, it bounced strongly to laminin in the basement membranes of formal and fixed mitral valves. So I'd say that's pretty strong evidence that laminin- It's not as strong as it's making it. It's pretty strong, right? That laminin and cardiac valves is another target of streptococcal M protein and this molecular mimicry issue. So that, yeah, I think that was pretty good evidence. Okay.
  Speaker 3
  So we've got streps and protein. We've got cardiac myosin and laminin, but you said there were four cardiac antigens and two bacterial antigens, so who's next? ([Time 0:12:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fc65c832-0f3f-4eb2-9d55-2c8eb9f2c600))
- Mimicry in Streptococcal Infections: Four cardiac antigens
  Key takeaways:
  (* Streptococcus mutans has four types of cardiac antigens that can lead to molecular mimicry and damage to the valves in groupbased strep infections., * Glycoproteins and lgligoproteins on the strep are similar to cardiac proteins and can also lead to molecular mimicry and damage to the valves in groupbased strep infections., * Collagen is another potential cardiac antigen that can lead to molecular mimicry and damage to the valves in groupbased strep infections.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The third type of cardiac antigen that we need to discuss and it's thought to contribute to molecular mimicry are glycoproteins, which are, as their name suggests, they're proteins that have sugar moieties attached to them. And cardiac valves are sort of awash with glycoproteins. And a study from Nature from way back in 1967 found that antibodies against glycoproteins on cardiac valve tissue also cross react against enacetyl glucosamine antigens from strep. So this is another point of molecular mimicry that's thought to lead to valvular damage in group-based strep infections. All right.
  Speaker 2
  So we've got the strep M protein that has some mimicry with myosin and laminin and then we have lgligoproteins on the strep, which are also similar to glycoproteins on the valves. So what's antigen number four slash a cardiac antigen number four total antigen number six?
  Speaker 1
  Yes. The drum roll on the final reveal is collagen. So this one isn't really a molecular mimicry, but it is thought to be relevant. And so cardiac valves contain lots of collagen, but normally it isn't exposed in an uninjured healthy valve, but with injury to the valve, some collagen gets exposed. And we've already talked about different immune mediated mechanisms for injury. And that probably, what happens is that probably exposes some of the valvular collagen. And for whatever reason, that streptococcal M protein we keep coming back to, apparently it binds to collagen and specifically type four collagen.

- The Connection Between Rheumatic Fever and the Mitral Valve
  Key takeaways:
  (* Collagen is important in the story of rheumatic fever and the mitral valve., * Molecular mimicry between the M protein from group Aestra and cardiac antigens leads to immunemediated attack on the heart.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes. The drum roll on the final reveal is collagen. So this one isn't really a molecular mimicry, but it is thought to be relevant. And so cardiac valves contain lots of collagen, but normally it isn't exposed in an uninjured healthy valve, but with injury to the valve, some collagen gets exposed. And we've already talked about different immune mediated mechanisms for injury. And that probably, what happens is that probably exposes some of the valvular collagen. And for whatever reason, that streptococcal M protein we keep coming back to, apparently it binds to collagen and specifically type four collagen.
  Speaker 3
  And so then the next step would maybe be that this sort of common M protein collagen has an antibody that's generated against it. Is that right?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, exactly. So a plus one study from 2009 found that the serum, the sera of patients from rheumatic heart disease contained antibodies that bound specifically to the part of type four collagen that M protein binds. That's pretty specific. And again, to sort of wrap up this part of the story, it's another indicator that collagen matters in this story.
  Speaker 2
  All right. So summarizing part one of explaining the connection between rheumatic fever and the mitral valve to room-ind our audience of all of the different antigens. We've learned that molecular mimicry between the M protein from group Aestra and cardiac antigens, including myosin and laminin, and then also acetyl glucosamine and the cardiac glycoproteins, leads to immune-mediated attack on the heart, most commonly the valves where all of that laminin is sitting.

- Mitral Valve Disease and Molecular Mimicry
  Key takeaways:
  (* Molecular mimicry between the M protein from group Aestra and cardiac antigens, including myosin and laminin, and then also acetyl glucosamine and the cardiac glycoproteins, leads to immunemediated attack on the heart, most commonly the valves where all of that laminin is sitting., * Antibodies against an M protein binding to type four collagen complex also plays a role somehow., * And we've got pretty good histological data for all of that. We know that these cause valvular dysfunction with the regurgitation and eventually sort of mixed with stenosis.)

  All right. So summarizing part one of explaining the connection between rheumatic fever and the mitral valve to room-ind our audience of all of the different antigens. We've learned that molecular mimicry between the M protein from group Aestra and cardiac antigens, including myosin and laminin, and then also acetyl glucosamine and the cardiac glycoproteins, leads to immune-mediated attack on the heart, most commonly the valves where all of that laminin is sitting. And that antibodies against an M protein binding to type four collagen complex also plays a role somehow. And we've got pretty good histological data for all of that. We know that these cause valvular dysfunction with the regurgitation and eventually sort of mixed with stenosis. And we've got a pretty straightforward linear explanation that bridges both histological evidence and long-term, very long-term clinical data. But I want to come back to one question that we talked about earlier in the episode, which is, why is the mitral valve the most commonly involved valve? I think in most pathologies, we see there's some physiological significance, but I don't often think of the mitral valve being all that involved. So why not the aortic valve or something?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, this also was sort of mysterious. Like why specifically the mitral valve? Why is it more susceptible to this chronic damage? And unfortunately, it isn't completely clear why rheumatic heart disease tends to involve the mitral valve more commonly than say the aortic valve. But one theory involves differences in sheer stress across the mitral valve compared to other valves. And so the theory goes that you have this high pressure gradient between the left atrium and ventricle that may actually predispose to some initial injury to the mitral valve in the setting of this sort of inflammatory state from rheumatic fever.
