## Highlights
- Safety Two Mindset
  Summary:
  A safety one focus where you're learning basically only from adverse events would never have reviewed that case. A safety two mindset is more about understanding what's going on in the soccer players in the field, even if there's no goal scored. And I love the way you approached that question or a similar circumstance like this one looked like, but that was difficult in the past and what happened there.

  Speaker 1
  right. So it appeared to go successfully. But yet, in fact, we were trying to manage the fact that the endotracheal tube tray was confusing to us and difficult to find the right size. And so from that, they redesigned the layout of the endotracheal tube tray. So that's kind of an example in health care of looks successful. Everything's fine. But yet, there's still something that you can do in terms of those pressure seconds that I know you're very well aware of.
  Speaker 2
  And so to circle back and bring that home for it. So a safety one focus where you're learning basically only from adverse events would never have reviewed that case because from a safety one perspective, only good things happened to the patient was intubated in the first past things are good. You move on with your day. A safety two case or a safety two mindset is more about understanding what's going on in the soccer players in the field, even if there's no goal scored and says, okay, well, what really happened here and what does that teach us and what can we learn from it. And I love the way you approached that question or the example that you're giving here where Dr. Brinkley did talking about did a similar circumstance like this one looked like, but that was difficult in the past and what happened there.

- What's Making Work Difficult?
  Summary:
  The first question you ask is, well, what made the work difficult. And quite often, if they people don't trust you or don't know you, they'll probably say, well, like, for example, pressure washing inside a large vessel. It is it really unlocks that kind of questioning really unlocks the learning.

  It is it really unlocks that kind of questioning really unlocks the learning. So I used to go around and do this, right. And the first question you ask is, well, what made the work difficult. And quite often, if they people don't trust you or don't know you, they'll probably say, well, like, for example, pressure washing inside a large vessel. So you're inside vessel with breathing equipment. So you've got a high pressure water spray, which if you got your fingers you lose the flesh of your fingers right so it's really high pressure. So the person comes out and starts chatting with me about it and you know what's making work difficult. Well, you know, I mean, this can find space and but yeah but everything's fine. You know, it's all it's, you know, we've got all we've done our risk assessment. We've got, you know, all our procedures, lots of a huge we have procedures and everything's fine but that's still a work as imagined conversation.

So then you say, well, you know, what's happened in the past and they go well, actually in the past, we have had an issue with the hose wrapping around my leg and causing a problem there. Okay, right. So then we have a conversation about how we could ameliorate that. And then the last question, and this is the one that if they really don't trust you, this is the one where you get the good stuff. Okay. If there's somebody less experienced than you, what could cause a problem for them? And then it all comes out.
  Speaker 2
  I love that. I absolutely love that. ([Time 0:28:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/972c0e63-570a-4c9c-bd2c-b7e933a42ea4))
- What's the Enemy of Learning?
  Summary:
  I want to ask one other question as we're sort of shifting towards the end of our time here together, which is another quote of yours that I'm like just so curious about. You said in one of the articles that you sent me ahead of time that certainty is the enemy of learning. Tell me more about this. Oh, what's that about that? Like, I was like, Oh, yeah, I'm writing that down. That's awesome.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Absolutely.
  Speaker 1
  And that's the issue is that people have been conditioned to kind of jump into this kind of a wall. Who's fault is this rather than saying, right, we just got to move forward. How can we support each other to to manage this situation?
  Speaker 2
  I want to ask one other question as we're sort of shifting towards the end of our time here together, which is another quote of yours that I've read that I'm like just so curious about. And you said, in one of the articles that you sent me ahead of time that certainty is the enemy of learning. Oh, yes. Oh, what's that about that? Like, I was like, Oh, yeah, I'm writing that down. That's awesome. Tell me more about this. ([Time 0:36:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4a68fb04-2add-4d1b-8fbd-4903a06c6b55))
- The Questioning Attitude
  Summary:
  "The most effective leaders have been the ones who've had this very open questioning attitude," she says. "And all the time, admit that they do not know the answer." She adds: "I love that because what it means is that they're always wanting to ask questions"
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, so when we're talking about some complicated situation going wrong, people could have a very strong opinion of what happened, who was responsible, and it, everything all seems so clear in hindsight. But yet, in reality, if we actually asked questions about, well, what were the precursors? What were the different influences that people were under? We find a much richer and bigger picture of what really occurred. So this idea of being certain, I'm absolutely certain that the train driver, Bob, was careless. Well, now what we're not going to actually look into the number of red signals past. We're just going to let things carry on as they are. So this questioning attitude, and I sometimes I call it curiosity, I find that the most effective leaders that I have met in the different industries that I've worked in have been the ones who've had this very open questioning attitude. And all the time, admit that they do not know the answer. So they are the least certain people I have ever met. And I love that because what it means is that they're always wanting ([Time 0:37:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9fcedc72-94f4-4dd8-8e7a-e932cf056510))
