## Highlights
- The Ejection Fraction is a Hundred %
  Summary:
  It's no orbl for the left ventegral to have an ejection fraction of a hndred %. Even if you can't see it like that, ventigral is probably not working super well when it's crunched all the way down. Some things on the echo report i find interesting too, as they might say, continuous outflow tract tracing. So your continuous wae doplar of the l vo d looks like a dagger. And also, we talked about gradients, so remind me. What are two numbers to remember for our l v o t gradient in the report? If the l ot gradient is greater than 30 millimeters, that's path
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And you
  Speaker 1
  know, that's not a good thing. Like, sometimes, you kno, ill get these x reports, the ejection fraction is a hundred %. And some people wi be like, ye, that's also, like the l v is kick and butt. Andha, were number one. Wer, number one. That always scares me, like it's no orbl for the left ventegral to have an ejection fraction of a hndred %. And like, you know, even if you can't see it like that, ventigral is probably not working super well when it's crunched all the way down. It's probly not good for the metrical to be like working that heard that surprise someone who's going to develop like a istress carting monopoly. So i feel like, even if you don't have these other findings, you know, if you see a heart where the ejection fraction is a undred %, that to me, says likeor maybe we should like, you know, decrease the onotropy, gives more fluid, gives more basil constrictor tryi to get this heart back like a normal
  Speaker 2
  ysiology, because not all the blood should be leafing the ha is what josh as saying. That's no benno a. Some things on the echo report i find interesting too, as they might say, dagger shaped, continuous outflow tract tracing. So your continuous wae doplar of the l vo d looks like a dagger. And josh gota picture of that up in the post. And also, we talked about gradients, so remind me. So we burn this into our memory. What are two numbers to remember for our l v o t gradient in the report, yes. So if
  Speaker 1
  the l ot gradient is greater than 30 millimeters, that's pathologically elevated. And if it's over 50 millimeters, at verely elevated, 30
  Speaker 2
  and 50, no. ([Time 0:13:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f49f6916-89ef-4757-b46b-028baaa65968))
