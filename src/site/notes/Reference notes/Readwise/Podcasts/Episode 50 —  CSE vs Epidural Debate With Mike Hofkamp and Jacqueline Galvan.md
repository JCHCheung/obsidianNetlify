## Highlights
- Dural Puncture Epidural - What Do You Think?
  Summary:
  Dural puncture epidurals are the preferred primary labral gesic technique. Skywing Michael Sarah Temple has been using them since June of this year. There is no difference between the epidural and the Dural punctured epidural, says Dr. Andrew Wexler.

  al. in 2007, and published a study that was published in 2017, actually did a head to head to head randomized control trial comparing Dural puncture epidurals to CSEs to regular epidurals. And their hypothesis was that the Dural puncture epidural would have intermediate effects. Like you'd get the good things of the epidural and the good things of the CSE and leave out the bad things of both. And that's kind of exactly what happened. And so when you compare the onset of allergies, you of course the CSE was quicker. But there is no difference between the epidural and the Dural puncture epidural. Now when you compare the block quality, the overall block quality between the Dural puncture epidural and the regular epidural, you're going to have a better block quality with decreased one side-ness with the Dural puncture epidural and you're going to have fewer side effects when you compare it to this combined spinal epidural. So I'll tell you what, like I said before, I am a reasonable person since June, my institution, Skywing Michael Sarah Temple, has done Dural puncture epidurals as the preferred primary labral gesic technique, so we are puncturing the Dural, we are ([Time 0:35:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/87c742dc-66b8-4a46-8d87-c73d860ef647))
