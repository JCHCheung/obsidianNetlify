## Highlights
- Atrial Tachyarrhythmias in Pulmonary Hypertension and RV Failure
  Key takeaways:
  - Atrial arrhythmias are not uncommon in patients with pulmonary hypertension, and they can have a significant negative impact on cardiac function.
  - Cardiologists and patients should be aware of the risk of atrial arrhythmias in patients with pulmonary hypertension and RV failure.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So obviously we know that atrial tachyarrhythmias are not uncommon in the context of pulmonary hypertension. We understand or at least we believe that they have a significant negative impact on cardiac function and they're usually not well hemodynamically tolerated in patients and pulmonary hypertension. So we obviously want our patients to be in sinus rhythm, not just rate control. And they certainly can be a night is or driver of RV failure. And then we have to be very vigilant when patients are admitted in either a volume overloaded state or in the context of RV failure that they are at risk of developing the atrial arrhythmias in that setting. So it's something again that we have to be aware of. And we do tend to think about the management of atrial arrhythmias distinctly in pulmonary hypertension and RV failure.
  Speaker 1
  The cardiologist and me comes out when you start mentioning arrhythmias and atrial tachycardias. When I started back in the early 2000s, my then partner, Stu Rich said, these patients don't get atrial arrhythmias. And I was like, well, how is that? And because we started seeing them and fundamentally the RA, the right atrium can it takes a while before you start to see atrial arrhythmias. You have to dilate a lot more than the left atrium with you just have a little bit of left atrial enlargement and you are at significant risk for a fib. It's not the same on the right side. So we didn't used to see it as often. But now patients are living so much longer that this is developing. The other thing I wanted to say is that if your heart rates over 100 and you're at rest, it's not normal even if it feels normal.

- Echo: Screening Tool for PA Pressure
  Key takeaways:
  - Rachel is a sonographer and she does not care about the PA pressure on the echo.
  - The PA pressure is a function of the blood pressure and heart rate at the time, and is not always a good sign.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is a dramatic case and I'm guessing based on your intro, Rachel, that she was an on meds at that time or not on very many meds because this is really dramatic and you don't usually see systemic PA pressure as a presentation unless it's a congenital heart disease or a really significant idiopathic heritable type. You don't get this high when it comes to associated causes or CTAF, right? So the mean is 61 but first I'm going to go with the echo which is an echo is a screening tool. I think that when it's done in the right place by the sonographers that are really attuned to looking at all these different measures, it's really helpful and it's a really good way to assess what's going on. Many times I'm asked about the PA pressure or the RV systolic estimated pressure on the echo and I got to tell you I never care and it drives everybody crazy because I say I just don't care because it's a function of the blood pressure and heart rate at the time. It's a function of the cardiac index and so actually decreasing RV systolic pressure estimations could be a worse sign and what I care about is what the RV looks like. So you gave me an example where here's the right ventricle. ([Time 0:18:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/894b949f-d947-4ad5-a3d1-f8ce67f12366))
- What is the significance of a low fractional area change on a TAPSI score?
  Key takeaways:
  - TAPSI is not a good measure to follow over time, as it can be normal or not a good indicator of RV dysfunction.
  - RV ejection fraction can be a better indicator of RV dysfunction.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I'm talking to a Hopkins group who Paul Forfea was the first paper looking at TAPSI. I got to tell you I don't like TAPSI that much either and I'm saying that with trepidation but it's because it's either normal or it's not a good measure to follow over time and that's because everybody here on this call has seen that when you have an acute PE it's not the part where the tricuspid annulises that goes bad. It's all the way up at the apex and so you could have a normal TAPSI with a severely enlarged RV and dysfunction. So here this case is dramatic, reduced and probably a function of how sick she is but it's not something that I look at in isolation. The fractional area change that you gave I think was 16% which is really low and it hits the high level severity of dysfunction. I think it's really important for those of you who don't know what fractional area changes. It's the ratio of the end systolic and endystolic area of the right ventricle and so what we found over time is that this correlates really well with the RV ejection fraction that we measure in MRI. I love RV EF by three dimensional echo. It hasn't panned out yet. ([Time 0:19:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a71a3a98-3554-42d8-bce2-33d0f2a67790))
- The Severity of the RV Failure on This Echo
  Key takeaways:
  - The RV is affected by interventricular interdependence and tricuspid regurgitation, which are both signs of severe pulmonary vascular disease.
  - The RA pressure is a good predictor of prognosis for patients with congenital heart disease.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I don't think it gives us a sense of how bad it is but it does show that the RV is affected because the interventricular interdependence is that much more significant when your RV fails. Then finally I think what's also really important on this is the tricuspid regurgitation and paracardial effusion. Tricuspid regurgitation even though it seems basic that the higher the velocity jet the worse off you are, it's really been shown over multiple data sets even to show as a function of change that if you went from a normal to an abnormal that predicts a worse prognosis. This RV essentially on this echo is awful and I think it's really important that you don't just take one measure and say oh the TAPSI looks normal and therefore it's okay. You really have to look at the images. Now when it comes to the cath, wow, also awful and consistent obviously with severe pulmonary vascular disease, the RA pressure is 11 and the wedge is 3 which makes me think that RV and RA is not working at all because we've unloaded the LV and still the RV is not normal and it's pressure. The RVEDP is probably the most prognostic thing that nobody talks about because 16 is really not good and especially congenital heart disease.

- Thermal Dilution Calculations in Congenital Heart Disease
  Key takeaways:
  - The right ventricle has to work extremely hard to pump blood through the circuit in patients with congenital heart disease,.
  - Thermal dilution is a better way to calculate thick than estimated thick.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I've learned it by default but the RVEDP of 16 tells me that there's not much RV reserve for something like this and atrial tachycardia. And then the mean PA61 again, this is because it's a congenital heart disease patient with severe vascular disease. The cardiac index is less than two which is a marker of a bad prognosis and the PVR which is supposed to be, we say less than three now it's even less than 2.2. It's 16 and a half. I mean it's awful. The amount of work that the right ventricle has to do in order to get through the circuit is enormous. And then I think what's also important is that even though we have thermal dilution and an estimated thick that when we do these calculations it's always with the thermal dilution. This is what we recommend in all of our guidelines. It doesn't matter if you have severe pH or severe TR. We've shown by colleague Marius Hoper, who's a good friend, he showed now it's over 20 years ago that in patients with severe TR, moderate TR, mild TR, he did the real thick and under the hood and actually calculated thermal dilution was better than estimated thick and it correlated nicely. So don't worry about how much TR there is, use the thermal dilution. ([Time 0:22:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/38702f5d-c196-4404-86b4-fba02fa33a20))
- The Differences Between the Right Ventricle and Left Ventricle
  Key takeaways:
  - The right ventricle is not the left ventricle,.
  - The development of the right and left ventricles is different.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And look at the images. I think that one of the things that I often get made fun of is this RV score that I inherited, which is you just look at the RV and the LV and you give it a score based on function and size. And when we looked at our database, Chicago, that was the best measure of prognosis and mortality over everything that we all look at. And it's because that's how we used to read echoes back when echo was developed. You just looked at it. You didn't do all these fancy calculations. And you know what? Severe has grades of severe, right? My colleagues, when they read an echo, severe, severe, but I look it in, I'm like, oh, that's not so bad. And it's again, the perspective and understanding that it can get that much worse. But you really just need to look at it. So you can make all the calculations you want, but if you don't look at the image, you might be missing something.
  Speaker 4
  Dr. Gomberg, thank you so much. I know I'm going to listen to that at least five times and try to digest all of the amazing pearls who just gave us and running through that data. You've already kind of led us into this, but can you just give us a brief overview of some of the practical differences between RV and LV failure?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, sure. I think it stems from the fact that the right ventricle is not the left ventricle. They're not identical twins and having had twins. I can say that mine are not identical. It's a boy and a girl and they're very different. And that's what we need to think about when it comes to the RV and the LV back to embryology. The development is different. The RV and the RV OT develop from the anterior hardfield, the LV and the atrial chambers from the primary hardfield. And this is why the LV can handle a pressure overload and the RV is more of a volume overload. ([Time 0:24:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/30aaffb0-13ed-4ea3-98c9-db428420bad1))
- The Differences Between the Right Ventricle and Left Ventricle
  Key takeaways:
  - The right ventricle and left ventricle are not identical twins and have different development.
  - The right ventricle is more prone to failure because it can't handle a pressure overload as well as the left ventricle.
  - The difference in coronary perfusion between the right and left ventricles is important.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, sure. I think it stems from the fact that the right ventricle is not the left ventricle. They're not identical twins and having had twins. I can say that mine are not identical. It's a boy and a girl and they're very different. And that's what we need to think about when it comes to the RV and the LV back to embryology. The development is different. The RV and the RV OT develop from the anterior hardfield, the LV and the atrial chambers from the primary hardfield. And this is why the LV can handle a pressure overload and the RV is more of a volume overload. The walls are different. They're standing the RV. They're thicker and the LV. The shapes different, one's crescent, which is why Echo's not that easy to do so often versus a spherical shape. And then just how it actually moves and contracts. Different, one's squeezing just from inflow to outflow, the other's squeezing and twisting. So I think that fundamentally they're different. But I think for me, what's most important when it comes to RV failure and what difference makes the most impact, it's really the coronary perfusion and perfusion pressure. 30, 40 years ago, we were measuring actually coronary sinus pressures and actually looking at these different perfusions. And that's where we get this from animal studies and from early calf lab data, which shows that the LV and RV auto regulate different. The differences in the right ventricle on the left ventricle when it comes to coronary perfusion. So the right coronary gets perfusion both insistly and diastly, whereas the left coronary is only diastly. And so why is that important?

- Management of Acute Retricular Failure in Shock or Low Perfusion
  Key takeaways:
  - Patients with decompensated RV failure, in shock or in a low perfusion state, need to be treated with normalizing measures to reduce the load on the heart.
  - Most patients with chronic pulmonary hypertension or PAH have excess preload, which means that the main goal is to normalize blood pressure and heart function.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Thank you so much. So I think let's jump into the management of acute retricular failure. I want to get back to our patient, Ms. Kay, who is by all evidence showing a very low perfusion at the time of her presentation. I think a lot of the discussion, Bobby and Dr. Damic over there, was about whether her acute decompensation was triggered by an atrial arrhythmia medication on adherence, as well as the contribution of volume overload. So I wanted to address this, Dr. Damic, in broad strokes, can you discuss the general management patients with decompensated RV failure, who are in shock or in a low perfusion state? What are some of the key tenants? Sure.
  Speaker 2
  So from my perspective, what I tried to both review in my head and teach trainees is I do it in categories. First you want to normalize as much as possible to treat load. Now in the vast majority of patients with chronic pulmonary hypertension or PAH, you come in with RV failure, they have excess preload. ([Time 0:28:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/919f0da7-870f-404d-91e3-1852599c20ec))
- Management of Acute Retricular Failure
  Key takeaways:
  - Patients with decompensated RV failure, who are in shock or in a low perfusion state, need to be normalized as much as possible to treat load and reduce afterload.
  - Normalizing preload involves either diuretics or US, and reducing afterload involves minimizing things that could exacerbate or worsen RV afterload.

Now in the vast majority of patients with chronic pulmonary hypertension or PAH, you come in with RV failure, they have excess preload. There are going to be rare exceptions. Patients who are vomiting have diarrhea. For some reason they're dehydrated. They have some mixed picture. But again, in most of our cases, they have excess preload and you're trying to normalize preload and that involves either diuretics or US, relate to get rid of that preload. The second category is reducing afterload. And that's really multi-factorial. You want to minimize things that could exacerbate or worsen RV afterload.

- Normalizing Preload in Pulmonary Hypertension
  Key takeaways:
  - Chronic pulmonary hypertension (CPH) is a condition in which the pulmonary arteries become enlarged and stiff, and the flow of blood through them is reduced.
  - CPH is caused by a number of factors, including RV failure and excess preload.
  - Reducing afterload is one of the main ways to treat CPH.
  - To reduce afterload, pulmonary hypertension providers try to avoid events that could make RV afterload worse.

The second category is reducing afterload. And that's really multi-factorial. You want to minimize things that could exacerbate or worsen RV afterload. So what would those things be? Certainly one we know is accidentally or intentionally withholding longstanding vasodilators. They're using their vasodilators. Those are RV afterload reducing agents. So we as pulmonary hypertension providers always tell our staff, never withhold them without a discussion with us. And certainly in someone who's an RV failure, that has to be a very thoughtful conversation before those drugs are withheld. Second, you want to try the best you can to avoid events that could make RV afterload worse. What could those be? Well, we're all aware of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. So we want to minimize hypoxia. But as a reminder, hypoxic vasoconstriction is exacerbated or potentiated by acidemia and hypercapnia. ([Time 0:29:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a37e2151-8e5b-4394-8630-7ebe746f8eb3))
- The Effects of Positive Pressure Ventilation on RV Function
  Key takeaways:
  - Minimizing the negative effects of positive pressure ventilation is important.
  - Inhaled vasodilators can be used to acutely reduce RV afterload.
  - Systemic vasodilators can be used to maintain adequate RV perfusion.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And again, we want to minimize the negative effects of positive pressure ventilation, if at all possible. So then there's some things we can specifically do in the ICU setting to try to acutely try to decrease RV afterload. And those would be things like inhaled vasodilators. So depending on where you are, what you have access to, that might be inhaled prostocyclins and or inhaled nitric oxide. But in this particular scenario, we actually initiated inhaled nitric oxide. And then the other obvious thing we can do in terms of trying to acutely reduce RV afterload is in the right context, you can introduce systemic vasodilators. And again, that was ultimately what was started within a few hours of this patient coming to the CEO and she was started an IV remodelant. So those are the preload and afterload components. The other thing I often think about and I want the health officers to remember is you have to maintain adequate RV perfusion. Just as we discussed, this is a really important component of RV function and dysfunction and decompensation as patients go through this spiral. While this is not necessarily evidence based, we tend to recommend the use of vasopressin and LibaFed to maintain adequate systemic blood pressure to make sure you have adequate RV perfusion. ([Time 0:31:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bc1b47ef-2d33-4adf-999d-fb07b1bc1027))
- The Role of Vasopressin and LibaFed in Maintaining Adequate RV Perfusion in Patients With Pulmonary Embolism
  Key takeaways:
  - RV function and dysfunction can be caused by a number of factors, including preload and afterload, and maintaining adequate RV perfusion is important.
  - Vasopressin and LibaFed can be used to maintain adequate systemic blood pressure, and identifying potential triggers is important.

While this is not necessarily evidence based, we tend to recommend the use of vasopressin and LibaFed to maintain adequate systemic blood pressure to make sure you have adequate RV perfusion. And in the right context, you can think about Iona tropes and a dilators, things like Dobutamine or Milrenone, but you have to recognize that these will often reduce your systemic blood pressure and so I really would discard you from running to those first. It's really those other four things. Then I think sixth in the lineup would be identifying what could have been the trigger and obviously trying to address any potential triggers that might be playing a role of things like pulmonary emboli infections, things of that nature. Obviously monitoring for arrhythmias because these patients have not developed an atrial with mirror at a high risk and then really the ([Time 0:31:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2067bb14-e581-4aef-af78-d69656337353))
- How to titrate medications in the ICU using a PA catheter
  Key takeaways:
  - Contrary to what many people believe, a PA catheter is not helpful in the ICU.
  - The main goal of using a PA catheter is to measure cardiac output, not to monitor PA pressure.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So I think contrary to what you might think I would say or how they do it elsewhere, I don't find a PA catheter to be helpful in this you or ICU. I find it's helpful if you have absolutely no idea what's going on and it's a new patient to you, but actually the risks associated with PA rupture and monitoring that is not worth the extra data you're going to get from that because what I really care about is fluid status and cardiac output. So how can I get that? I can get that with just a neckline with just getting a CVP, anamix venus set. Look, if you don't know what's going on and you do a swan, which in this case you should be doing under fluoroscopy because it's such an enlarged RV and PA that you really wouldn't want to be doing that bedside. You could leave it in, but what's the extra data that you're getting? You're just getting PA pressures and there's nothing worse than just looking at a PA pressure continuously because it's just not going to change or it's going to change when you cough or it's going to change when you're in pain and it's going to change when you vagal all things that you don't want and it's not going to change your management. So you're not titrating any medications to a PA pressure. It's not like any cute, high pretense of emergency. This is something that you really want to get flow and you want to get your, as Rachel said, the preload is key. ([Time 0:33:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/137b9787-f50b-4df5-b4fc-a0b090869b29))
- The Importance of Preload in the Treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction
  Key takeaways:
  - Following the right atrial pressure and the mix is more important than using a PA catheter.
  - Serial echoes are not necessary for measuring PA pressure.
  - Preload is more important than afterload in terms of affecting myocardial function.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I'm much happier just following the right atrial pressure and the mix being a sat once a shift and calling it a day because that's really what's the most important and your an output. And so I'm not getting any of that stuff extra from a PA catheter. So I typically don't swan them and keep them just like my LV. I think it's very different. I think what we need to measure can be measured well without having the swan. I also don't really use serial echoes in the ICU as a non-invasive way. And again, that's because of all the issues that come with echo and its variability and what are you actually measuring. So you don't need the IVC because you have the CBP and the RV is not going to just dramatically shrink and become unloaded. Rachel did a really nice job of going through preload and afterload and frankly, I think the most important thing is the preload more than afterload because even when we have patients in clinical studies back when we were against placebo, the mean PA pressure drop like four or five millimeters of mercury, that's not a huge afterload reduction. So all of our medicines aren't going to acutely draw the afterload. What it's going to do is increase blood flow. And what we've learned over time is that they actually end up probably helping the myocardium more than they're happening the pulmonary vasculature, even in the acute setting.

- Preload Management in Shock Patients: A Resident's Perspective
  Key takeaways:
  - Dr. Damico recommends being conservative when treating patients with RV dysfunction or failure, as they may not be able to compensate for rapid shifts.
  - Dr. Damico also recommends being patient with these patients, as they may not be in a condition to make quick decisions.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  That's phenomenal. Like you had mentioned, preload management is such a poor aspect of care of these patients. So I think that's something that we wanted to dive a little bit deeper into. Dr. Damico, could you talk about your approach for diarrhea, cis or volume removal in these patients, specifically including some goals? Obviously, no two patients are the same, but in broad strokes as a resident, one of the things that we're taught very early is the classic teaching of be very careful when direasing somebody with RV, failure or RV dysfunction, no more than net negative of 500 ccs or so. I must have been told that 10 times is an intern. So I question, how true is that?
  Speaker 2
  So in general, I hope I didn't tell you that no more than five years ago.
  Speaker 3
  It was not you.
  Speaker 2
  So I think one of the things, there's clearly a big difference between someone who gets admitted for volume overload and someone like her who's in shock. So that's important. I think what to remember is we tend to be conservative when someone's just admitted for volume overload, primarily because patients in general, if they're not decompensated, you don't want to push them over the edge by doing anything too fast. And the one thing you can't order on the computer is time and patience. And so while you've been probably taught to go slow and people use that 500 number at some marker of slowness, it's really just not to cause rapid shifts that are not necessary if it's nothing catastrophic is happening because patients don't have the ability to compensate if you have rapid shifts. I think the term, and I hope I don't say anything, Dr. ([Time 0:37:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/22628f7d-7459-48e4-a4ed-763a54ad037b))
- Pulmonary Beta Dilators: What to Do in the Acute Setting
  Key takeaways:
  - There are three FDA approved pulmonary beta dilators: cedentaphil, cedentaphil, and no cedentaphil can't be given IV.
  - PDE5 inhibitors are still an option for those with pulmonary hypertension.

  So thank you for those excellent tips, everyone. So I wanted to ask you both about treatment options for afterload reduction for the RV, especially in regards to pulmonary beta dilators. I know you both do extensive work in this space and pH medications are something many of us aren't as familiar with compared to more common medications in both of our fields. So what are some of the general classes of pulmonary beta dilators and what should we do with a patient's home medications in the acute setting? Sure.
  Speaker 2
  So right now we currently have three pathways that we can approach with FDA approved drugs for pulmonary hypertension. We have inadequate nitric oxide signaling in patients with pulmonary hypertension and familiar options there from what we currently have would be the PDE5 inhibitors that in the US would be cedentaphil and cedentaphil. Of no cedentaphil can be given IV so patients who are too real or can't take POs or vomiting. It's always important to recognize you still have an option for giving them PDE5 inhibitors as an IV formulation. ([Time 0:42:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/64b8a6e1-47fb-4f11-8efe-615e0a4690ee))
- The Different Pathways Targeted for Pulmonary Hypertension Drugs
  Key takeaways:
  - There are three pathways that are currently being targeted with FDA approved drugs for pulmonary hypertension.
  - The PDE5 inhibitors are the most common option, but there are other options as well.
  - It is important to be aware of the potential interactions between these drugs and to avoid using them together.

  So right now we currently have three pathways that we can approach with FDA approved drugs for pulmonary hypertension. We have inadequate nitric oxide signaling in patients with pulmonary hypertension and familiar options there from what we currently have would be the PDE5 inhibitors that in the US would be cedentaphil and cedentaphil. Of no cedentaphil can be given IV so patients who are too real or can't take POs or vomiting. It's always important to recognize you still have an option for giving them PDE5 inhibitors as an IV formulation. Also within that pathway but not a phosphodorous inhibitor would be a damp pass or you say, what this is a sick of GMP activator. Again the clinical pearl there to remember is that those drugs cannot be used together and should not be used with nitrates and nitrates because they should potentiate one another. So that would represent one of the calming classes and again probably the most common used drugs or the PDE5 inhibitors. The second pathway we target is the endothelion pathway. There's too much endotheline one when patients have pulmonary hypertension and currently we have three antagonists to that pathway. They're all oral, bosantin, literus and massy tantin. Then the third pathway would be the prostocyclin pathway. And again this is historically important because it's the first class of drugs we had.

- House Officers: What to Know About Pulmonary Hypertension Drugs
  Key takeaways:
  - There are three pathways that house officers can target when treating pulmonary hypertension patients, and currently FDA approved drugs that are specific for each pathway.
  - It is important to be aware of which drugs are on a patient's formulary, and to ensure that the drugs are delivered in a way that is appropriate for that patient.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So those represent the three pathways we target and the currently FDA approved drugs that are specific for the treatment of pulmonary or trial hypertension. And then a couple of key things for house officers to know about those different drugs. Again we strongly discourage anyone with holding these drugs without communication with pulmonary hypertension providers because of the dangers. It's also important to recognize that many institutions don't have access to all those drugs or delivery systems to give all those drugs. So these are important things to know that if you admit a patient who is on a drug it's important to recognize whether you do or don't have it on your formulary and that a patient's family may have to bring in their medication. If it's not on your formulary this would be specific for the ERAs because many of those are not on all hospital formularies because they're part of REMS programs. Inelational drugs like Tae-Veso have to be delivered to a specialized device. And so again these are all things to be aware of especially if someone's coming in the middle of the night. Not only that you know what drugs there are that you're writing for the correct drugs but you have an actual mechanism to deliver those drugs.
  Speaker 1
  I just wanted to add that all of our oral meds can't be crushed so if you're not taking PO we don't want to do that. I get asked that a lot. ([Time 0:44:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c0893311-2c29-4b18-9023-ba650354a399))
- Young Patient with Congenital Heart Disease and Acute RV Failure: The Prognosis
  Key takeaways:
  - Ms. Kay spontaneously reverted back to normal scifi rhythm and was placed on amioderon to help maintain her rhythm.
  - She was initially placed on vasopressin for a presser and started on hail nitric oxide for acute afterload reduction.
  - Correct oxemia was observed during this time.
  - As I take it, a challenging decision was made to start her IVtraprostinol processiclet analog and she was really carefully monitored during that time.
  - She did really well under one successful diarrhea system with loop diuretics alone and eventually her hypoxia improved and she was transitioned back to room air and pressers were successful.
  - Throughout her hospitalization, she was evaluated by the transplant team and by the shock team for consideration of, well, should she progress and compensate further.
  - Before we finish, I think it's really important to address the morbidity of this type of presentation.
  - Dr. Gomberg, what is the general prognosis for this patient population as a whole? What's your approach to hold status discussion, patient and family discussions in these situations?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Thank you so much. That was really phenomenal. To get the conclusion to our case, talk a little bit about her management. Ms. Kay spontaneously reverted back to normal sci-fi rhythm. She was placed on amioderon to help maintain her sci-fi rhythm. She was initially placed on vasopressin for a presser and started on hail nitric oxide for acute afterload reduction. Correct oxemia. As I take it, a challenging decision was made to start her IV-traprostinol processiclet analog and she was really carefully monitored during that time. She did really well under one successful diarrhea system with loop diuretics alone and eventually her hypoxia improved and she was transitioned back to room air and pressers were we successfully. Throughout her hospitalization, she was evaluated by the transplant team and by the shock team for consideration of, well, should she progress and compensate further. Before we finish, I think it's really important to address the morbidity of this type of presentation. Dr. Gomberg, what is the general prognosis for this patient population as a whole? What's your approach to hold status discussion, patient and family discussions in these situations?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I think that like all ICU patients, this needs to be discussed in somebody that's got acute RV failure, the prognosis just entering the unit can be at 40% mortality. So even if they look okay and it's a young patient and this patient has congenital heart disease and ([Time 0:54:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/73575e11-2d4f-4797-9fce-64922b35f180))
- The Importance of Coding in the Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension
  Key takeaways:
  - Heart failure patients don't have many options for treatment if their RV fails, and their prognosis is not good.
  - It's important to code these patients appropriately in order to provide the best possible care for them and their families.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Heart failure, we don't have all those interventional devices yet for RV failure to get them through the ICU stay and understanding that their prognosis is not good, I think makes it so that it's not a surprise if these measures that we're taking and being very aggressive don't work. Because after a few days, if your RV is not going to recover, it's not going to recover. If you are escalating pressures, I think it's very similar to most ICU shock patients. But I think that the issue of coding is extremely important because now it's over 20 years ago, they did a study and looked at all the patients that presented with pulmonary hypertension in Germany. And the amount of patients that left the hospital after a code was like out of 100, it was like five without neurologic deficit. Part of being a physician is caring for patients in the best way possible both with living and improving their quality of life, but also in their death. And I think that it's as important, if not more important, that happens. And so even if there's a possibility of reversing what's going on, having an arrhythmic death and getting intubated is really not what we're trying to do. We need to do what's best for the patient and for the family. ([Time 0:57:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/23d6f64f-d3fc-4059-9f4d-e26e73dd2010))
