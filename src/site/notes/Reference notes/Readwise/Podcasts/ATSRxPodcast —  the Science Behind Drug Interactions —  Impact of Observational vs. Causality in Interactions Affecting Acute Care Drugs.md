## Highlights
- Cistern C: A New biomarker for assessing renal function in critically ill patients
  Key takeaways:
  - Cistern C has some advantages over creatinine, including a shorter halflife and less affected by changes in muscle mass.
  - Cistern C may be advantageous for critically ill patients, especially considering the changes in muscle mass that happen during critical illness.

  It's crazy. All these biomarkers that are on the horizon, it kind of makes me wonder what we'll be using in practice. And if you're not at least before we retire, it's not much sooner. Do you think cistern C will be something that we're going to be using more at the bedside in the future? Because I know I'm not using it right now, but it would be interesting to think, you know, by 10 years, it might be something that I'm using a lot more than I'm using creatinine.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I think there definitely is a role for cistern C. And we likely should see, you know, I think it would make sense to use it more often. You know, is it something that should, you know, replace creatinine? I'm not sure. So, so cistern C definitely has some advantages relative to creatinine. You know, as I mentioned, shorter half-life, less affected by changes in muscle mass. And so those are some key advantages. So those are potentially advantageous and critically ill patients, especially considering, you know, the changes in muscle mass that happened during critical illness.
