## Highlights
- HEFFF Patients Lack Cardiovascular Output Reserve
  Summary:
  The crux of the question or the paradox really centers around this idea that people with HEFFF have a normal cardiac output. At rest, most patients with HEFFf have anormal cardiac output and normal cardiac index. So what's interesting and something that I hadn't learned is that these patients lack cardiac output reserve.

  So the crux of the question or the paradox really centers around this idea that people with HEFFF or preserved EF have a normal cardiac output. And that, that makes a lot of sense because their left ventricular ejection fraction is normal. But is there actually data to show that cardiac output is normal in HEFFF? Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  So at rest, most patients with HEFFF have a normal cardiac output and normal cardiac index. It's sort of, depending on the study, they'll report one or the other. So what's interesting and something that I hadn't learned is that these patients lack cardiac output reserve. So basically they're unable to increase their heart rate with exercise, leaving them unable to augment their cardiac output to the same extent as patients who don't have HEFFF. There are probably multiple reasons why this happens. So for example, there is probably down regulation of beta receptors and desensitization to catacolomines, catacolomines are chronically elevated in this state. But regardless of the mechanism, this chronic tropic incompetence, this inability to augment heart rate means ([TimeÂ 0:03:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/84eee6b6-faee-4c4d-92fa-b0ab2b7b7c08))
