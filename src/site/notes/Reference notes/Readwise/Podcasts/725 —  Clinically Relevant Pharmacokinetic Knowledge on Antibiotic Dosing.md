Questions nine, ten, 11 and 12 of the survey all tie back into understanding drivers behind drug half life and how they can change in critical illness. Question nine lists volume of distribution and clearance, and asks, how do these perimeters change in the initial phase of septic shock, following adequate volume resuscitation, both volume of distribution and clearance increase in septic shock following resuscitation, volume of distribution increases because the added fluids add to the theoretical compartment that medications distribute into.
