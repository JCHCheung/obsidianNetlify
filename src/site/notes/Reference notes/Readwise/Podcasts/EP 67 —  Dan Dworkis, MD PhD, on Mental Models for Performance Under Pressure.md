## Highlights
- Five Critical Mental Models That Will Help You Perform Under Pressure
  Summary:
  dan as: In this video, we're going to explore five critical mental models that will help you improve your ability to perform under pressure. The models are the yurk dodsen curve, the itso matrix, the wedge model and the prepare perform, recover and evolve cycle. There's a lot of depth in each of these that we're not going to go into, and this will really just provide you a much more indepth over view of what we're talking about.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Ok, all that said, let's jump into this episode, and ore going to dig deep into these mental models. I hope you enjoy. Hey folks, i'm dan as, and this is the emergency mind project. And in this video, we're going to explore five critical mental models that will help you, your team and your organization improve your ability to perform under pressure. Now all of these are models we've touched on briefly during conversations in the emergency mind podcast, which, by the way, you can find at emergency mind dot com slash pod ast. But our goal for this video is really to explore a little bit deeper into each of these mental models so you have a real sense of what we're talking about and can really understand when they come up in conversation. So the models we're gong to look at are the yurk dodsen curve, the itso matrix, the wedge model, the prepare perform, recover and evolve cycle the island chain model. Now for each of these models, i'm going to explore and sort of explain the model as a general over view to start with, and then we're ging to dig in and look at a couple of the salient features of it. There's a lot of depth in each of these that we're not going to go into, and this will really just provide you a much more indepth over view of what we're talking about. So we're going to start with the yurk dadsen curve. The yurk sdadsen curve is a exploration of how humans perform under pressure, how individuals perform under pressure. And what it looks at is the relationship of how performance varies as we increase the stress and pressure in a particular situation.

- Iso Matrix - Is Ito?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  If it's an individual level technique, it's really mostly on you to figure it out as a person, or on your team mate, who's the individual doing it. If it's a team based approach, then you realy need to have by in of everybody who's working on that particular problem set. And if it's a structural braced approach, obviously ed to go in order of magnitude up and make sure there's by in fromthe organization. The other thing the ito matrix lets you do is map your entire portfolio of techniques that you're using, right? So if you have a couple of things that you particularly ere a a small set of things that your group does to improve performance under pressure, you can map all of them along the ito matrix, and you'll be able to pretty clearly dentify where youare putting your time and energy and also what holes you have available that you need to work on. Right? So if you find that most of the techniques you're currently working on are things that are deployed by an individual on shift, but really you haven't done any work in terms of structural things that are done off shift, the itomatrix will help you ind that and be able to really address it. All right. So that's the iso matrix. Again, a itso is i t s o. And the i t s stands for the individual, team and structural levels, and the o is a mix of the on and off. So the itso matrix a three by two matrix that gives you a framework for localizing techniques you're working with. Ok, here we go with model three, which is the wedge model.

- The Island Chain Model
  Summary:
  Low wedge practice is deploying your techniques that allow you to perform under pressure in these low stake scenarios, things like spilling a cup of coffee. Island chain model is about breaking down complex things into simpler parts. And it's aboutbea in down the mental effort of tackling a really complex scenario into the mental efforts of moving between islands in a chain.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And here we have an example of an extremely low edged scenario, which is you spilled coffee. Now at first you might not be able to draw a straight line between figuring out how you handle spilled coffee and how you hand cardiac arest, but it's all along this wedge, right? So extremely low wedge practice is deploying your techniques that allow you to perform under pressure in these low stake scenarios, things like spilling a cup of coffee, before you're really rolling it out. In even low edge practice, which is simulated, or high wedge practice, which is all the way a real life cenario. O gat. So that's the wedge model. We're going to use this triangle to describe it, and we're going to use our low edged scenarios to help us out before we're really deploying techniques in high wedge situations. All right, on to model number four, which is the island chain model. Now this is a de that is really on the individual and team side of stuff, if we think about it in the isomatrix. And it's something that's really deployed mostly on the axe. And what this model is about is about breaking down complex things into simpler parts. And it's aboutbea in down the mental effort of tackling a really complex scenario into the mental effort of moving between islands in a chain. And the best way to sort of describe this is that imagine you'r trying to do a thing under pressure. ([Time 0:16:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e73524d6-c7c2-474b-8771-65d52843b627))
- The First Island in the Chain of Islands
  Summary:
  In the cardiac arest example, we can imagine that getting everything from zero to b l s level skills is the first island that we're going to get to. In each of these letters in this sort of a model, are individual islands where you know what to do. And already we've done a couple of things that are really important, which is that we've overcome the friction of inaction. When we start running a critical case, or when we first encounter an emergency, it can be hard to figure out what to do,. We're trying to get from a to z.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Write in each of these letters in this sort of a model, are individual islands where you know what to do. So again, when we're thinking about the cardiac arest example, right? We can imagine that getting everything from zero to b l s level skills is the first island that we're going to get to, right? So we come into a room the patients and cardiac arest, ok, we got a lot going on while going to concentrate, instead of on the whole thing, just on getting to the first island that we understand. Ok, what does it take to run b l s? Well, let's get a chest compressions on going, and let's get somebody on the airway with a bag valve mask, and let's call for back up. Ok? Gra, that is a good first step, right? Made it to the first island in this chain of islands. All right, well, now what'll we do? Well, let's get from b l s level skills a, to the next step. Well, let's put pads on the patient a, let's get an i v into them, and let's get to the point where we can start delivering our a l s level of care, right? So again, we're moving from zero to the first which is b s level of care, and then we can move from there to the second island, which is a s level of care. And already we've done a couple of things that are really important, which is that we've overcome the friction of inaction. When we start running a critical case, or when we first encounter an emergency, it can be hard to figure out what to do, because we're looking at the whole path. We're trying to get from a to z.
