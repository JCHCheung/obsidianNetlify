## Highlights
- The Language of Meaning Channel Conversations
  Key takeaways:
  (* It is helpful to talk about beneficence, non maleficence, and autonomy within the context of healthcare., * However, when one is at the bedside, one's focus should be on fear, anger, guilt, and sadness, rather than on the language used.)

  It is helpful to talk about, you know, beneficence, non maleficence, autonomy, justice within the framework of this. But when you're there and you're at the bedside, that is not what's going on. It's fear, anger, guilt, sadness. And really, your focus should be there. And understanding that this person who's asking me to do this thing that seems unreasonable is doing so because they're speaking with their amygdala and not their cortex. And understanding that the language that I use needs to be language that comes from my amygdala and speaks to their amygdala. That's why I don't use words like the creatinine today is three. It was 1.6 yesterday and the potassium 7.2 and they have PT waves. And now I'm worried that they're going to have a lethal arrhythmia. That is cortex language that is not helpful. The language that is helpful is what I call meaning channel language. And if you ever take vital talk for a really good communication skills course, they'll give you this language. And, you know, for that patient who added renal failure in the potassium 7.2 and needs renal replacement therapy and is on the door to lethal arrhythmia, the language there, I'm so sorry that your mom is so sick. I'm worried she's going to die sooner than we need to talk about that. That's a meaning channel conversation. I'm speaking to what matters to you and the things that you need to know to sort of make the decisions. ([Time 0:18:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d9adea7d-31b5-4261-ba85-9b87d71f9247))
- Dialysis for a High School Graduation in a Week and a Half
  Key takeaways:
  (* Dialysis can be an effective way to help someone achieve a goal, as long as the goal is achievable., * It is important to understand what the goal is in order to make an informed decision about whether dialysis is the right treatment for a person.)

  I would definitely categorize this as potentially inappropriate. When you talk about assessing whether something's futile, potentially inappropriate, you have a treatment and you have a goal, right? So the treatment here is dialysis. And the question that you have to have is what is the goal, right? Because it's possible that that would meet the definition of futility actually, depending on what their goal is. If their goal is that they want their loved one to pitch in a major league baseball game, I can relatively, but they're never going to get a transplant and their melt score is 40. I'm comfortable saying that that's a futile request. That will not achieve the goal to which you are dedicated. But if your goal is to see your daughter get married in three weeks, oh, I can do that, probably, right? I mean, I can't guarantee it. There's a whole bunch of things that could go wrong between now and then. But dialysis is definitively something that I would offer you to get you to that point. And so, you know, that's why it's really important that you understand what is it that you're hoping to accomplish and achieve with this. Because if you tell me you want to see your grandson's high school graduation in a week and a half, then you know what? Not only can you do dialysis, you probably should.
