## Highlights
- The Basics of Labor Analgesia
  Summary:
  The first stage of labor is when the uterus begins to contract regularly and the cervix makes change all the way until 10 centimeters of dilation. The second stage combines not only pain from the first stage but also the somatic pain of the fetus descending into the vaginal canal and then eventually out of the vaginal canal. It's generally a diffuse pain sort of ill-defined in terms of any exact location.

  Exactly, great. You can think of it, divide it into the first stage and the second stage. The first stage of labor is when the uterus begins to contract regularly and the cervix makes change all the way until 10 centimeters of dilation. This pain is typically described as visceral in nature arising from the lower uterine segment and the cervix in terms of spinal cord origins from T10 to L1 and is generally a diffuse pain sort of ill-defined in terms of any exact location. The second stage of labor combines not only pain from the first stage but also the somatic pain of the fetus descending into the vaginal canal and then eventually out of the vaginal canal.

- The Second Stage of Labor
  Summary:
  The first stage of labor is when the uterus begins to contract regularly and the cervix makes change all the way until 10 centimeters of dilation. The second stage combines not only pain from the first stage but also the somatic pain of the fetus descending into the vaginal canal and then eventually out of the vaginal canal. This involves deformation of the perineal tissues and the vagina which can cause referred pain to the thighs, the legs, the buttocks and the back.

This involves deformation of the perineal tissues and the vagina and that pain not only includes T10 to L1 at the first stage but all the way through S4 including the pedundal nerves. This pain can also have referred pain to the thighs, the legs, the buttocks and the back.
  Speaker 1
  Two distinct different origins where this pain is coming from. ([Time 0:01:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0a08eeac-6622-4b53-9734-93614d7c0500))
