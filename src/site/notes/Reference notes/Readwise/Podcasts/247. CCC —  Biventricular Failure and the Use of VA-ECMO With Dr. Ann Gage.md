## Highlights
- Mechanical Circulatory Support
  Summary:
  VA ECMO is utilized for severe refractory cardiogenic shock. This may be seen in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure or myocarditis. The patient should have a high left ventricular endiostolic pressure, low stroke volume and low ejection fraction.

  Sure, those are great questions to start with. VA ECMO is utilized for severe refractory cardiogenic shock. This may be seen in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, myocarditis, refractory ventricular arrhythmias, severe infection, post cardiotomy with failure to wean from bypass, or with primary graft failure after heart transplantation. It is imperative to understand the baseline pathophysiology and hemodynamics of the patient in front of us. Our initial assessment of hemodynamics is the basis for our subsequent clinical decisions for all mechanical circulatory support. Obtaining and assessing a patient's hemodynamics and then coupling this with the knowledge of a given mechanical devices, hemodynamic profile is the first step in the initiation of mechanical circulatory support. Let's take a patient with acute cardiogenic shock. Say an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction from an LED occlusion or acute myocarditis. In this situation, we expect our patient to have a high left ventricular endiostolic pressure, low stroke volume, and low ejection fraction. This leads to a decrease in cardiac output, an increased systemic vascular resistance, or SVR. The cardiac power output should be low, and if the right ventricle is involved, the pulmonary artery pulsaticity index, or PAPI, will also be decreased.

- Va Ecmo
  Summary:
  ECMO circuits have multiple possible configurations. Centrally cannulated ECMO requires an astomosis of the cannula to a blood vessel and is most frequently used in post cardiotomy patients. It is also possible to have percutaneously placed left atrial VA ECMO. This configuration is utilized most frequently in patients with severe lung injury.

  Centrally cannulated ECMO requires an astomosis of the cannula to a blood vessel and is most frequently used in post cardiotomy patients. It is usually placed by a cardiac surgeon. ECMO circuits have multiple possible configurations. In the most typical VA ECMO configuration, a venous inflow cannula is placed via the common femoral vein with the tip of the cannula in the IVC near the right atrium. And the arterial or outflow cannula is placed via the common femoral artery with the cannula tip in the descending aorta. This configuration is sometimes modified, so the point of entry of the venous cannula is the internal jugular, and the arterial cannula is in the axillary artery. It is also possible to have percutaneously placed left atrial VA ECMO. In this configuration, the venous inflow cannula enters the body via the common femoral vein, it then traverses the interatrial septum, and is in placed with the tip in the left atrium. This is most commonly performed using the proprietary T&M heart system, or with an Edwards cannula that has the ability to drain from both the left atrium and the right atrium. One other form of peripherally cannulated ECMO you may encounter is VA V ECMO. This configuration is utilized most frequently in patients with severe lung injury. A second return cannula is added post oxygenator, such that the arterial blood returning to the body is split into two cannulas.

- ECMO Increases LV Afterload
  Summary:
  The venous cannula is going to drain blood from the systemic venous system and decrease the right-sided preload. ECMO increases LV afterload, which leads to increased pressure in left ventricle. Dr. Gage: These changes significantly increase myocardial oxygen demand and can worsen LV function.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 4
  Gage. Now, we had started talking about this previously, but we really need to hammer home the physiology for ECMO to manage these patients. The venous cannula is going to drain blood from the systemic venous system and decrease the right-sided preload, and then the arterial cannula is going to return this blood retrograde into the aorta, and that's how you maintain systemic perfusion. Also, not all of the blood on the right side is going to be diverted into the ECMO cannula. Some blood is going to follow the normal route from the right side, through the lungs to the left side, and out the aortic valve, if it can. So, basically, our already weak left ventricles are going to try to pump out whatever blood is returning to the LV, but also has to overcome the afterload introduced by the flow from the arterial cannula. Dr. Gage, can you talk us through this physiology a little bit more, and can you highlight some of the consequences of increased afterload introduced by the ECMO circuit?
  Speaker 1
  Yoav, that was a really elegant summary of VA ECMO physiology. So, what can I add? Repeat this over and over. ECMO increases LV afterload. ECMO increases LV afterload. In the face of increased afterload, blood accumulates in the left ventricle. This increases the LV endiastolic pressure, the left atrial pressure, and the pulmonary capillary pressure. In other words, all left-sided pressures will rise. These changes significantly increase myocardial oxygen demand and can worsen LV function.

- LV Endiastolic Pressure, Left Atrial Pressure, and Pulmonary Capillary Pressure Rise
  Summary:
  ECMO increases LV afterload, blood accumulates in the left ventricle. This increases the LV endiastolic pressure, the left atrial pressure, and the pulmonary capillary pressure. These changes significantly increase myocardial oxygen demand and can worsen LV function. It is this exact physiology we hope to avoid in patients with acute cardiogenic shock.

In other words, all left-sided pressures will rise. These changes significantly increase myocardial oxygen demand and can worsen LV function. This is the exact physiology we hope to avoid in patients with acute cardiogenic shock, especially those with acute ischemic insults, such as acute myocardial ischemia or infarction. If the failing LV is unable to generate sufficient pressure in the face of this increased afterload, the aortic valve fails to open. The LV becomes distended, and stasis of blood with subsequent thrombosis can occur. Additionally, the rise in left-sided pressures can lead to worsening pulmonary edema and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

  Thanks, Dr. Gage. So, our patient is getting set up in the CICU back from the cath lab, and we did get some more information. ([Time 0:30:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/34516acf-89bc-4a7b-9fad-eece031d47ba))
- VA ECMO and LV Unloading
  Summary:
  Pulmonary edema, LV distention and LV thrombosis are known as LV venting. These maneuvers attempt to lower left-sided pressures and volumes,. further decompressing the left ventricle. Dr. Gage: How do you identify patients who would benefit from LV unloading while they're on VA ECMO?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Thanks, Dr. Gage. So, our patient is getting set up in the CICU back from the cath lab, and we did get some more information. The PA-Cathitor demonstrated a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 millimeters of mercury, PA pressure of 50 over 30, and a CVP of 15 while flowing at 4.5 liters. The bedside echo showed an injection fraction of 10% with severe LV and RV hypokinesis, and the LV is moderately dilated. The aortic valve is opening intermittently, and the risk-pontaneous echocontrass seen in the LV. The chest x-ray, a pain to confirm PA positioning, also shows pulmonary edema. This patient is certainly demonstrating consequences and signs of LV distention and pulmonary edema that we just talked about. Dr. Gage, how do you identify patients who would benefit from LV unloading while they're on VA ECMO, and what are some of the strategies that we can utilize here?
  Speaker 1
  Protecting the left ventricle and the lungs from the deleterious effects of VA ECMO are fundamental components of VA ECMO management. When the pulmonary venous pressure is elevated, the patient is at risk for pulmonary edema. Strategies to avoid pulmonary edema, LV distention, and LV thrombosis are known as LV venting. These maneuvers attempt to lower left-sided pressures and volumes, further decompressing the left ventricle. ([Time 0:31:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/59141061-5275-4ec3-917f-332f04d35099))
- Is LV Venting Necessary for VA ECMO?
  Summary:
  Left ventricular venting with the intra aortic balloon pump, impella, or other percutaneous or surgical techniques resulted in more successful weaning from veno arterial ECMO. Based on this data and similar data from other meta-analyses, I think that it is reasonable to consider LV unloading for appropriately selected patients undergoing VA ECMO. If you see any of the following: Elevated left-sided filling pressures, pulmonary edema, evidence of LV distinction, or LV thrombus,. Or failure of the aortic valve to open on echocardiogram.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So, let's begin with the data that we have. In a systematic review in meta-analysis of 62 studies, including nearly 8,000 patients published in 2019, left ventricular venting with the intra aortic balloon pump, impella, or other percutaneous or surgical techniques, resulted in more successful weaning from veno arterial ECMO, as well as reduction of 30-day mortality, especially when LV venting was implemented in less than 12 hours from the initiation of VA ECMO. Based on this data and similar data from other meta-analyses, in the absence of prospective randomized data, I think that it is reasonable to consider LV unloading for appropriately selected patients undergoing VA ECMO. I personally have conflicting thoughts about LV venting. I do not believe it is necessary for all patients. However, the data supports early initiation of venting, and from a logistical and technical perspective, placement of an LV vent at the time of ECMO initiation is much easier than deciding to initiate venting hours today after the deployment of ECMO. I pursue LV venting in ECMO patients if I see any of the following. Elevated left-sided filling pressures, pulmonary edema, evidence of LV distinction, or LV thrombus, or failure of the aortic valve to open on echocardiogram. Based on meta-analysis data, there was no heterogeneity in the association between LV unloading and decreased mortality in relation to the specific left ventricular unloading strategy.

- Va Ecmo
  Summary:
  In patients with normal lung function, blood ejected from the left ventricle is fully oxygenated. If this blood is relatively deoxygenated due to abnormal pulmonary gas exchange, upper body hypoxia can occur. This is known as North South or Harlequin syndrome. Patients supported with VA ECMO should be monitored with an arterial line,. ideally placed in the right arm, exactly as you did in this patient.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  In patients with normal lung function, blood ejected from the left ventricle is fully oxygenated. However, many ECMO patients have perincomol lung injuries, which limit normal gas exchange. In this situation, the left ventricle may eject blood with a low PAO2. If LV contractility is high enough, the mixing cloud may occur distal to the take off of the cerebral vessels, meaning all of the blood flow to the coronary arteries, right upper extremity, and cerebral vessels comes from the LV and not the ECMO canula. If this blood is relatively deoxygenated due to abnormal pulmonary gas exchange, upper body hypoxia can occur. This is known as North South or Harlequin syndrome. Patients supported with VA ECMO should be monitored with an arterial line, ideally placed in the right arm, exactly as you did in this patient. In this location, blood gas sampling is indicative of the oxygen content delivered to the coronaries and to the cerebral arteries. Additionally, the arterial line allows for monitoring of pulsatility, which is often used as a surrogate for cardiac contractility. If the arterial line tracing begins to show an increased pulse pressure and your ABG shows a decreased PAO2, this should raise concern for potential coronary and cerebral hypoxia.

- Weaning ECMO
  Summary:
  The decision to begin weaning ECMO assumes you believe the patient has had enough myocardial recovery. Weaning ECMO relies on real-time assessment of invasive hemodynamics and echocardiography. It's really wonderful to hear the outcome for your patient. I hope that everyone involved in his care was very proud of the care that was provided.

  It's really wonderful to hear the outcome for your patient. I hope that everyone involved in his care was very proud of the care that was provided. The decision to begin weaning ECMO assumes you believe the patient has had enough myocardial recovery to meet the body's circulation and oxygen demands. Ideally, end organ dysfunction should be improved, recovering, or supported by other means such as CRRT or mechanical ventilation. Prior to beginning any attempts at weaning your ECMO support, many protocols for weaning ECMO exist. However, no data supports the superiority of one strategy over another. So I guess I'll tell you what I do. For me, weaning ECMO relies on real-time assessment of invasive hemodynamics and echocardiography. ECMO flows are slowly decreased by a half to one liter per minute until ECMO support is only one to one and a half liters per minute. This increases the preload of the right heart and simulates the loading conditions the heart will face after decanulation.

- Weaning ECMO
  Summary:
  The decision to begin weaning ECMO assumes you believe the patient has had enough myocardial recovery. Weaning ECMO relies on real-time assessment of invasive hemodynamics and echocardiography. A successful wean is marked by acceptable filling pressures on your PA catheter, maintenance of a mean arterial pressure greater than 65 millimeters of mercury.

On ECHO, there should be no left ventricular or right ventricular distention, no evidence of stasis, and the aortic VTI should be greater than 10 centimeters.
