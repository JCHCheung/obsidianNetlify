## Highlights
- Don't Trust That Blood Sample
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  And so often
  Speaker 1
  what happens is somebody pokes,
  Speaker 3
  they get a little bit of blood, the blood flow stops, and then they move the needle a little bit and they get alittle more blood. What's probably just happened there is they've poked a micky mouse ear and a micky mouse head. And what they have in the syringe is a mixture of venus and arterial blood. So if the blood does not come out quickly, it may not be a reliable sample.
  Speaker 1
  Pointnuber one. Point
  Speaker 3
  number two is, you fill the syringe up with blood, right? And
  Speaker 1
  then what? Well, there's a special cap you're supposed to put on so you can get all the air out.
  Speaker 3
  If you don't get the air out, what' going to happen is that
  Speaker 1
  little air bubble is going to transfer oxygen into the blood. Ad you'll get spurious high numbers.
  Speaker 3
  There's froth there. There's a lot of bubbles. That
  Speaker 1
  sample is worthless, right? Because there's so much surface area. You're basically oxygen in their blood in the tube. So don't trust that sample. There's
  Speaker 3
  a couple other things to know. So assuming
  Speaker 1
  you, you
  Speaker 3
  are analyzing at point of care, so you hand it to like, a statnurs they run it right there, and you get results two minutes later. That's
  Speaker 1
  a really good sample. But
  Speaker 3
  if you send it off to a spentral lab and it, like, sits around for a while, it
  Speaker 1
  can be, it can be falsely high, if there's a bubble, or it can also be falsely low. And
  Speaker 3
  there's one really good situation were you'll see this, which
  Speaker 1
  is the person with a super high white when
  Speaker 3
  youv got like a white count over a hundred thousand, you draw blood gas on them, and it'sgoing to have a really
  Speaker 1
  terrifyingly low p a o two. ([Time 1:09:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2a127f60-4626-4033-8f7f-2b8c125aca9f))
