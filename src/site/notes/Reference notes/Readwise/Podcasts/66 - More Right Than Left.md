## Highlights
- The Differences in Pathogenesis of Infective Endocarditis Between the Right and Left Sides
  Key takeaways:
  - There is a difference in the valvular distribution of infective endocarditis, with tricuspid valve being more commonly involved in those who inject drugs.
  - The pathogenesis of infective endocarditis involves three steps: endothelial injury, thrombus formation, and bacteria infection.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Okay, so you've pretty clearly shown that there's a difference in the valvular distribution, but something that I don't quite understand is that the portal of entry for most bacteria is the venous system. So like aggressive tooth brushing on the bone marrow transplant unit or injection drug use that we're talking about. So why wouldn't right-sided endocarditis be more common than left in all causes of infective endocarditis since hypothetically all of the bacteria have direct access to those valves first?
  Speaker 1
  I think it's a really important question and it's one that I didn't think to ask myself until I started looking into this topic. So in order to understand both our initial question of why tricuspid valve is more commonly involved in those who inject drugs, it's essential to first understand the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis just more generally. And in doing so, we'll cover why left-sided is more common overall. And so there are at least three steps required for infective endocarditis to occur. First, there needs to be valvular endothelial injury. Second, a thrombus forms at the site of this injury. And then third, and finally, bacteria see this thrombus causing not surprisingly infective endocarditis. Okay. ([Time 0:03:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6b78efd4-b5bb-4d6c-ad87-fcd5eaa1df2e))
- The Role of Venturi Tube Experiments in the Modeling of Endocarditis
  Key takeaways:
  - The venturi tube experiment by Simon Robert in 1963 showed that high pressure drives an infected fluid to a low pressure sink, which creates the characteristic pattern of bacterial colony distribution in endocarditis.
  - This explains why most vegetations are on the ventricular side of the aortic valve and the atrial side of the mitral valve.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So it's probably high pressures and velocities. So in 1963, Simon Robert published a set of experiments using venturi tubes to model flow across valves. And remember that venturi tubes are shaped like an hourglass and contain an area of constriction that varies the flow. So Robert injected a bacterial aerosol into the air stream passing through one of these venturi tubes. And he showed that high pressure drives an infected fluid to a low pressure sink. And that this creates the characteristic pattern of bacterial colony distribution in endocarditis. That is such a cool experiment. It is, and the pictures are fascinating because you see this colony formation right where there is this low pressure sink. And so the thought is that the high velocity in turbulence created when blood flows from a high to a low pressure area across a narrow at orifice traumatizes and injures the endothelial surface.
  Speaker 3
  So we've got this sort of extremely elegant experiment by Robert from the 1960s sort of modeling what happens as fluid is flowing through these valves and demonstrating where bacteria may tend to land on valves. Does this explain why most vegetations are on the ventricular side of the aortic valve and the atrial side of the mitral valve?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, it's thought to because again, these are the low pressure sinks through which blood flows from areas of high pressure. But this means that you typically have some regurgent flow to see this injury happen. ([Time 0:05:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/768fd00f-d746-4e9e-aeb7-1c5cc8670b56))
- Virchow's Triad and Hematology in Endocarditis
  Key takeaways:
  - Endothelial injury is more common with high pressure valves on the left side of the heart.
  - The formation of microthrombi at the site of injury is the second step in the development of infective endocarditis.
  - Infective endocarditis can be caused without the first two steps, by affecting normal heart valve tissue.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Okay. So step one is endothelial injury, which for most forms of endocarditis is more common with high pressure valves on the left side of the heart. And Tony, going back to that three-step framework that you laid out at the beginning, step two, you said, is the formation of microthrombi at the site of injury. Can you tell us more about that?
  Speaker 1
  I definitely can. So the second step is the formation of a thrombus consisting of platelets interwoven with strands of fibrin. And these thrombi, they develop at the sites of endothelial injury and they're actually what the bacteria infect if someone develops infective endocarditis. That of course is the third step, right? The generation and the infection of the bacteria into that thrombus, right? So step one, endothelial injury, step two, formation of thrombus, step three, actual infection of that thrombus. Now I think there's a good time to note that with staph aureus, staph aureus may be a little bit unique in its ability to cause infective endocarditis without these first two steps. It seems to be able to affect normal heart valve tissue, but most cases of infective endocarditis, even those caused by staph aureus, you still need endothelial injury. You still need the formation of a thrombus.
  Speaker 2
  I love that even in a somewhat cardiology ID episode, we're touching on Virchow's triad and hematology. ([Time 0:08:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/43e47d6c-893a-455f-a346-6861bcf046b8))
- The Role of Particulate Matter in Injuring the Tricuspid Valve
  Key takeaways:
  - Particulate matter that comes with injected material is likely to lead to repeated injury to the tricuspid valve.
  - This is a scenario where it's being the first valve accessed probably plays a role.
  - There is a lot of different types of injected material, and some of it is going to bombard the tricuspid valve.
  - The diameter of the pulmonary capillaries is probably protective against endothelial injury induced by larger particles.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That's the thought. So particulate matter that comes with the injected material likely leads to repeated injury to the tricuspid valve. And this is a scenario where it's being the first valve accessed probably does play a role. And as you can imagine, there's a lot of different things that are injected in the setting of IV drug use. Again, the particulate matter is in very sizes, but some of that is going to bombard that tricuspid valve. Hmm.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, that's really interesting. And I wonder if eventually someday we'll study it and be able to give people better advice about like cotton using and types of needles and stuff like that. Can we go back to why the right side of the heart? Like why doesn't that also affect the left side of the heart? Since eventually the same blood with that same particular matter is going to come to the left heart.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I think this is the exact right question. But you have to remember that the particulate matter, the blood must first pass through Avi's favorite set of paired filters. And of course, we're not talking about the kidneys. Instead, we're talking about the lungs. So the diaphragm. I like the kidneys too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those are fighting words. I don't know. Something tells me that you cause a lot of AKI in your ICU. So.
  Speaker 3
  We call it permissive asetemia. Yeah, exactly.
  Speaker 1
  Well, so for your favorite organ, the lungs, the thing to know is that the diameter of the pulmonary capillaries is about six microns. And this probably protects the aortic and mitral valve from endothelial injury induced by larger particles that are typically seen in the setting of injection.
