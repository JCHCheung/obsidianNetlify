## Highlights
- The RV vs the LV
  Summary:
  The right ventricle appears triangular when viewed from the side and crescent-shaped when viewed in cross-section. It is a thin-walled structure which has much more capacitance than the LV, that is the ability to hold on to more volume. The torque glop waspilical model is one of my favorite models that well describe important muscle fiber differences in the RV versus the LV. There are obliquely-oriented muscle fibers in the septum, which are shared with the LV, and contraction of these fibers contribute to the longitudinal motion of the RV.

  Speaker 5
  So honing in on the myocardial causes of right sided failure. Dr. Tetford, just before we go see these patients, can you tell us broadly how the RV differs from the LV? Absolutely.
  Speaker 1
  Let's really think about two major differences, the first being significant structural differences. In contrast to the ellipsoidal shape of the LV, the right ventricle appears triangular when viewed from the side and crescent-shaped when viewed in cross-section. It is a thin-walled structure which has much more capacitance than the LV, that is the ability to hold on to more volume, but because it is thin walled, it is also much more sensitive to changes in afterload, both in the acute and chronic setting. Structurally, it's composed of three different sections, the inlet, which includes the tricuspid valve, the cordae, the papillary muscles, the trabeculated apical myocardium, and the third section is the outlet, including the infinidibulum raconus and the pulmonary valve. The torque glop waspilical model is one of my favorite models that well describe important muscle fiber differences in the RV versus the LV. There are obliquely-oriented muscle fibers in the septum, which are shared with the LV, and contraction of these fibers and the associated LV twist contribute to the longitudinal motion of the RV.

And this, of course, is the lion's shear of RV contractility, and it also means that the right ventricle depends on the left ventricle for a substantial portion of its contractile function.

- The RV Myocardium Dystifen
  Summary:
  The right ventricle depends on the left ventricle for a substantial portion of its contractile function. The RV has evolved to receive blood from a low-pressure venous system and pump it into yet another system that is very distensible. As such, the RV handles volume loads, which is preload, much better than pressure as afterload. This underlies how the RV responds to different stressors. So I would say those are the major important differences that everybody should know.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And this, of course, is the lion's shear of RV contractility, and it also means that the right ventricle depends on the left ventricle for a substantial portion of its contractile function. The free wall of the RV, on the other hand, has circumferentially-worried muscle fibers that are less efficient but are able to compensate for impaired septal function as long as afterload is normal. But I think we'll find many situations, including the cases today, where that is not, in fact, true. The second major difference is the blood supply. Because the RV is thinner walled, a wall tension is usually not as high as in the LV, and so therefore it's not high enough to prevent flow during systole. Therefore, in the right coronary artery, the flow is biphasic. It occurs during systole and diastole. Although, again, this can change with the development of pulmonary hypertension. So I would say those are the major important differences that everybody should know.
  Speaker 4
  Thank you so much for reviewing these critical structural blood supply differences that really make the bedrock of our understanding of the RV. So the RV has evolved to receive blood from a low-pressure venous system as you just alluded to, Dr. Tetford, and pump it into yet another system that has low impedance and is very distensible. As such, the RV handles volume loads, which is preload, much better than pressure as afterload, and this underlies how the RV responds to different stressors. So, Dr. Tetford, can you briefly explain the concept of RV PA coupling and why it is so, so important to understanding RV function? Absolutely.

  Speaker 1
  RV PA coupling is one of my favorite concepts and refers to the interaction of RV contractility, that is the intrinsic ability of the RV myocardium dystifen, and the afterload imposed on it from the pulmonary circulation, which includes both resistive and pulsatile components of load. RV PA coupling is the most comprehensive description of RV function and therefore the gold standard, and it's traditionally assessed via multi-beat pressure-vowing relations. Great. Thank you.

- Acute Pulmonary Embolism - Can You Explain the McConnell Sign?
  Summary:
  A 40-year-old woman presented with acute chest discomfort and shortness of breath. She had a heart rate of 132, blood pressure of 89 over 68, an O2 side of 88 on two liters of mesocanula. Given concern for pulmonary embolisms, she was given one liter of IV fluids,. started on heparin and epinephrine drips; stabilized before being taken for CT chest angiogram. This showed a large burden of multiloveular PEs and a dilated RV in the CICU.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Thanks, Dr. Tetford, for that primer. That is incredibly helpful. So now, let's go see our patients. So we got a room one, and this is a 40-year-old woman who presented with acute chest discomfort and shortness of breath. Her exam demonstrated a heart rate of 132, blood pressure of 89 over 68, an O2 side of 88 on two liters of mesocanula. Her EKG showed sinostactic cardia, a dominant R-wave in V1, late R-wave progression with anterior prechordial T-wave inversions, and an incomplete right bundle branch block. On labs, she had an anion gap of 16, a lactate of 5, a troponin I of 0.3 nanograms per deciliter, and an NT-Pro BMP of 2000. She had said EKG revealed a moderately dilated RV with a hyperkinetic apex, an akinetic free wall, moderate TR, and an RVSP estimated at 36 millimeters of mercury. Given concern for pulmonary embolisms, who was given one liter of IV fluids, started on heparin and epinephrine drips, and stabilized before being taken for CT chest angiogram. This showed a large burden of multiloveular PEs and a dilated RV, and was then brought to the CICU. And she referred, given our framework for understanding RV failure, can you walk us through the acute pathophysiology for this patient and how this has affected her RV now?
  Speaker 1
  Sure, and I think I should start by saying this is quite a sick patient in the Schulman words, and obviously someone here who's in cardiogenic shock. And the evaluation of the patient, I liked the touch of the McConnell sign, the hyperkinetic apex, an akinetic free wall. I think it's probably worth describing three possible theories of why we might see this in an acute pulmonary embolism. And the first actually goes back to what we were discussing before, and that's the shared septal fibers between the RV and the LV. The tethering of the right ventricular apex to a contracting and often hyperdynamic LV may account for some of the preserved wall motion at the apex. The other possibility is that the right ventricle may assume a more spherical shape to equalize regional wall stress due to that increased afterload. ([Time 0:10:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a072b5cc-93bc-4e71-a5b8-e592e50d1626))
- The RVSP Is Not Very High
  Summary:
  The right ventricle may assume a more spherical shape to equalize regional wall stress due to that increased afterload. Or again, going back to that torn Guaspila, he look a model, the circumferential fibers are really not efficient enough to contract against that higher afterload. And then thirdly, that there may be more localized ischemia of the RV free wall as a result of that increased wall stress.

- RV Contractile Dysfunction
  Summary:
  This patient is a case of a pure RV contractile dysfunction from ischemia. Afterload here should be completely normal. In the absence of high rhodiological pressure, fluid loading may serve to increase in transformer gradient and improve cardiac output,. And based on your echo assessment, we see the IV with small and collapsible. So indeed, this may be an initial strategy. However, it usually works best just in the short term to temporize cardiac output with hope that the injured RV myocardium recovers or contractility improves.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Hey everyone, reviewing the films now. That is an amazing result Dan. And with a door to balloon time in 10 minutes, you must have had access even before the patient even had chest pain, but we're not out of the woods just yet. Dr. Tetford, can you walk us through this patient's RV physiology and how this differs from the first patient? I'd be happy to.
  Speaker 1
  Obviously, very different issues with this patient. Yet a common theme of RV failure. This patient is a case of a pure RV contractile dysfunction from ischemia.
  Speaker 2
  Afterload here should be completely normal.
  Speaker 1
  And in the absence of high rhodiological pressure, fluid loading may serve to increase in transformer gradient and improve cardiac output, at least temporarily. And based on your echo assessment, we see the IV with small and collapsible. So indeed, this may be an initial strategy. We know that the acutely injured RV typically tolerates fluid administration because of its compliant thin walled structure and its capacitance and accommodates changes in preload, allowing for RV dilatation and preservation of stroke volume. However, it usually works best just in the short term to temporize cardiac output with hope that the injured RV myocardium recovers, contractility improves, and the rhodometrical can generate the necessary transpulmonary gradient to preserve cardiac output.

- Is There a Way to Prevent a Stroke Injured RV?
  Summary:
  We know that the acutely injured RV typically tolerates fluid administration because of its compliant thin walled structure and its capacitance. And in the absence of high rhodiological pressure, fluid loading may serve to increase in transformer gradient and improve cardiac output, at least temporarily. But if fluid loading is excessive, applied over lung redoration, or given in the setting of an already elevated central venous pressure, the RV dilatation can be detrimental. It can actually increase pericardio-constrate, resulting in reduced effective distending pressure of the LV,. That is less LV preload. All of these three issues compromise the heart's ability to generate the transpulmonary gradient necessary

Unfortunately, and something we see quite commonly is if fluid loading is excessive, applied over lung redoration, or given in the setting of an already elevated central venous pressure, the RV dilatation can be detrimental. It can actually increase pericardio-constrate, resulting in reduced effective distending pressure of the LV, that is less LV preload. It may serve to compress the left ventricle, cause LV disalptus function, or increase left atrial pressure. And lastly, it could even cause tricuspid regurgitation from poor co-optation of the tricuspic bobble leaflets. All of these three issues compromise the heart's ability to generate the transpulmonary gradient necessary to maintain cardiac output.

- Chronic VPA Coupling - What Is It?
  Summary:
  The RV tolerates chronic and gradual increases in afterload much better than it does in the acute setting. We then also have to consider primary contractile impairments. The one that I think about a lot is the rhythmic riboncricular cardomyopathy. And commonly, none of these actually occur in isolation. Two or three of these issues may be going on.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, as you all stated earlier, the most common cause of right-heart failure is left-heart failure. So, I always keep that in mind and assess for the presence of left-heart disease. But similar to before, I really go back and consider the idea of our VPA coupling. So, we have several high afterload chronic states that we have to consider. Of course, all the different subgroups of pulmonary hypertension, group one, pulmonary arterial hypertension, other pre-cappulary pH to include group three or pH-utolum disease, group four from chronic thermal bulk disease, and group five from a myriad of different conditions, including sarcoide, and then group two, pH-utolumptar disease. It is important to note that the RV tolerates chronic and gradual increases in afterload much better than it does in the acute setting. We then also have to consider primary contractile impairments. The one that I think about a lot is the rhythmic riboncricular cardomyopathy. We can also see isolated RV cardiac sarcoide enough transplant and a few patients who have presented with this physiology, and then those who have had prior RV insults like isolated RV microditis or RV in archin. Now, I also have to consider high preload states when I'm thinking about chronic RV failure. This can be a result of shunts, either intracardiac or large systemic shunts like avifistulas, as well as tricuspid regurgitation, either primary or secondary, due to RV volume overall. And commonly, none of these actually occur in isolation. Two or three of these issues may be going on. ([Time 0:17:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f251d3cc-273d-4aa1-9301-00fb4c866bf0))
- Physiology of Pulmonary Artery Hypertension
  Summary:
  An EKG shows a severely hypertrophy and dilated RV with severe trachospid regurgitation. There's also diastolic and systolic ventricular septal flattening. The flattened septum in both diastole and systole suggests we have chronic pressure and volume overload. In most cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension, intrinsic RV contractility is not impaired.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Again, your point here about how complex this physiology is is what makes me so incredulous that this will be the people's forgotten ventricle. I mean, it's so fascinating just working through all these physiologic kind of entanglements. But with this background, let's just get back to rounding and examine our next patient. So in room three, we have a 65 year old woman with known pulmonary arterial hypertension who's on amber sentin and inhaled to Prostinum, who's here with worsening shortness of breath and hypotension. Her exam revealed a heart rate of 72, blood pressure of 90 over 60, and O2 of 90% on two liters to a canula with an EKG showing sinus rhythm, right axis deviation, and an RV strain pattern. That's how that goes shows a severely hypertrophy and dilated RV with severe trachospid regurgitation and an estimated RVSP of 78 millimeters of mercury. There's also diastolic and systolic ventricular septal flattening. Dr. Tetford, it seems here that we have changes that are related with chronic increases in afterload, which are then affecting contractility and preload as well. Can you explain how pulmonary hypertension leads to the chronic picture that we're seeing here?
  Speaker 1
  We certainly are seeing this, and as we discussed briefly before with more gradual increases in afterload, the RV is initially able to compensate through hypertrophy and RV dilatation. Its compliance though with this hypertrophy will decline and will actually just start to behave more like the LV and it becomes less tolerant to volume changes. And in fact here, the flattened septum in both diastole and systole suggests we have chronic pressure and volume overload. Now it's important to know that in most cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension, intrinsic RV contractility is actually not impaired. ([Time 0:19:54](https://share.snipd.com/snip/19f6f4fb-40e3-473f-8402-104d39fa90ef))
- Isomegors Pulmonary Hypertension?
  Summary:
  The flattened septum in both diastole and systole suggests we have chronic pressure and volume overload. In most cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension, intrinsic RV contractility is actually not impaired. An exception is an entity like scleroderma, where we do seek contractile impairments in addition to increases in afterload.

Its compliance though with this hypertrophy will decline and will actually just start to behave more like the LV and it becomes less tolerant to volume changes. And in fact here, the flattened septum in both diastole and systole suggests we have chronic pressure and volume overload. Now it's important to know that in most cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension, intrinsic RV contractility is actually not impaired. If you take autopsy samples from patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and isomegors pulmonary hypertension and looked at the individual ability of those myocytes to contract, they actually have super contractile force generation compared to controls. An exception is an entity like scleroderma, where we do seek contractile impairments in addition to increases in afterload. And the latter is also true in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction as well as some forms of heft-peth.
  Speaker 3
  Dr. Tefred, that was very helpful. You spoke a little bit about the interaction between the RV and the LV and kind of that flattened septum in this situation. And so we know it's not just the RV that was affected with RV dysfunction, but also affects the LV as well. Can you external further the concept of ventricular independence and how it fits in with this patient specifically? Sure.
  Speaker 1
  There's really a couple of considerations. First is that septal deformation through pressure and volume overload will reduce RV longitudinal contractility and global RV function. And as we said before, this longitudinal motion accounts for the lion's shear of ventricular function. ([Time 0:21:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fbd2c0a9-858a-4246-b30c-0f39948779e4))

  There's really a couple of considerations. First is that septal deformation through pressure and volume overload will reduce RV longitudinal contractility and global RV function. And as we said before, this longitudinal motion accounts for the lion's shear of ventricular function. Secondly, though, as right atrial pressure and right atrial volumes increase, the pericardial pressures rise and this may lead to pericardial restraint or constraint. If you measure left atrial pressure in this situation, it may have actually gone up due to this pericardial restraint, although the effective distending pressure of the LV, that is true LV pre-low, may actually have fallen further and again further reducing cardiac output. This is a complicated issue, the idea of pericardial restraint, but it is a very important one to grasp.

- The Right-Hard Catheterization of Heart Failure
  Summary:
  The right-hard catheterization, in this case, will really help us understand the etiology and the differences between these three patients. I'm going to be wanting to assess a RV preload as well as afterload in addition to left-sided pressures. For LV contributions in RV afterload, I'm looking at the wedge pressure, the pulmonary vascular resistance, and the pulmonary arterial compliance. And then to understand RV compensation, we can look at right-hard pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and more specific parametersLooking at the RV, like the right- hard pressure to wedge ratio, or the pulmonary artery pulsability index (PAPI) The latter of which is the
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Karen, this is an important question and thanks for the shout out. It really is hard to get the right-hard catheterization right, so it's worth taking some time to make sure we're all on the same page about how this should be performed. But the right-hard catheterization, in this case, will really help us understand the etiology and the differences between these three patients. I'm going to be wanting to assess a RV preload as well as afterload in addition to left-sided pressures. For LV contributions in RV afterload, I'm looking at the wedge pressure, the pulmonary vascular resistance, and the pulmonary arterial compliance. And then to understand RV compensation, we can look at right-hard pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and more specific parameters looking at the RV, like the right-hard pressure to wedge ratio, or the pulmonary artery pulsability index or PAPI, the latter of which is the ratio of pulmonary artery pulse pressure to right-hard pressure. Stephen Su, a former colleague of mine, published in the European Journal of Fertilier, a really nice study where he took individual myocytes from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients and looked to see when he exposed them to different calcium concentrations and the maximal force generation that those myocytes could generate, how that compared to hematodynamics measured in the cath lab. And he actually found that PAPI correlated best with intrinsic myocardial contractility. So I think that is a nice tool that we have. I do want to say a couple of caveats about PAPI. And one is we have to think a little bit about what determines pulse pressure. And we know from medical school that pulse pressure is determined by two main factors, one is stroke volume, and the other is compliance. Now, this is important because a high or low pulse pressure can be impacted by the compliance of the circulation. ([Time 0:24:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9c460dbf-91c4-4b1a-9c42-589422e356bb))
- PAPI and Heart Failure
  Summary:
  PAPI is very sensitive to the absolute right-hard pressure because it's in the denominator of the equation. So, for example, you could have a patient with a right-hatial pressure of two and PAPI would still be able to tell if they're having heart failure or not. The other caveat I just want you to remember is that PAPI is verysensitive to the absoluteright-hard pressure as well.
