## Highlights
- What is a Platelet?
  Key takeaways:
  (* Whole blood derived platelets are not pulled out during the blood donation process, and are instead left in the plasma., * Platelets that are given during a blood donation process are usually from a feresis process, which is a longer donation process that takes a larger pool of blood., * A unit of platelets is not a fixed volume, and starts out as a unit of whole blood.)

  Now platelets are a little confusing because you can pull these out of the whole blood. These are called whole blood derived platelets. However, the blood donation process that is most common, at least here in the United States, does not make use of these. Those whole blood derived platelets are not pulled out. They just are actually left in usually the plasma. So in a way, you're giving them, but they're probably not active once they've been frozen in thawed. The platelets we actually give are usually from a feresis process. So you donate these separately, they go and take your blood, they spin off platelets return it to you. It's a longer donation process, but they take a larger pool of it out. It usually ends up being the equivalent of about maybe five or six units of whole blood derived platelets. So these feresis or single donor platelet packs come in these kind of larger bags, whereas a unit of red cells or of plasma is equivalent to what came out of one unit of whole blood. So a unit is not a fixed volume. It starts out as a unit of whole blood, and then a unit of components is what came out of one unit of whole blood. And then the confusing part is the platelets. I actually recommend to people not to say a unit of platelets because it becomes unclear. ([Time 0:05:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/661cd89f-1782-4d30-baf8-f45122f1e952))
- How to Store Platelets for Long-Term Storage
  Key takeaways:
  (* Platelets should be stored at room temperature., * Cryoprecipitate is not always produced and can be harmful if not stored correctly., * Platelets are the highest risk product for transfusionrelated bacterial infections.)

  Do you mean that unit equivalent of a whole blood derived platelet unit or one bag? Which is most common because most places here in the states, that's all you can give. That's what they have. So I just call it a pack of platelets usually. And each just know is it the equivalent in your area of five units worth or six units worth or whatever. Now there's a belief that storing platelets at anything other than room temperature can be harmful to them. Temperature streams, extremes, either cooling or actually warming affects their function. Now there's, I know some controversy on this in the blood-macking world, and it's not academic because this ends up meeting that platelets can only be stored at room temperature so they don't last very long. And this is why you've probably run out of platelets at times. Even in larger centers, platelets are always in shortage. So if we could say refrigerate them, they would last a lot longer. But this is also why if you're doing like a massive transfusion, you're not really supposed to put platelets through the warmer. You're just supposed to run them to gravity at room temperature. It's also why platelets are considered the highest risk product for transfusion-related bacterial infections because they're just sitting there incubating on the shelf. There's one other component which is not always produced called cryoprecipitat. ([Time 0:06:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2d16cbb6-453d-4edd-b527-97b2bea93088))

- How Blood Products Are Processed for Medical Use
  Key takeaways:
  - Liquid plasma can be thawed using a warm water bath before use.
  - Some trauma centers keep liquid plasma on hand to avoid waiting for it to thaw.
  - Platelets can be derived from whole blood or donated through a feresis process.
  - Whole blood derived platelets are usually left in the plasma and may not be active after being frozen and thawed.
  - Feresis or single donor platelet packs provide a larger pool of platelets equivalent to five or six units of whole blood derived platelets.

  And then when it actually needs to be used, it gets thawed. They put it in a little warm water bath. It circulates around. Takes about 20 minutes. And some of the most busy, usually trauma centers, they may keep some liquid plasma on hand either thawed or actually liquid plasma that was never frozen. So you don't have to wait for it to thaw. And then there's platelets. Now platelets are a little confusing because you can pull these out of the whole blood. These are called whole blood derived platelets.

- Storing Platelets and Their Risks
  Key takeaways:
  - The term 'pack of platelets' is commonly used in the US to refer to a unit equivalent of whole blood-derived platelets.
  - Storing platelets at temperatures other than room temperature can negatively affect their function.
  - Platelets can only be stored at room temperature, which limits their lifespan.
  - Platelets are often in short supply, even in larger centers.
  - Refrigeration could significantly extend the lifespan of platelets.
  - Platelets are not recommended to be warmed during transfusions, especially in massive transfusion cases.
  - Platelets are considered the highest risk product for transfusion-related bacterial infections due to their shelf incubation.

There's one other component which is not always produced called cryoprecipitat. Now cryo is a collection of specific proteins and factors from the plasma. Now normally these will be left in the FFP, but if you want to produce cryo, you kind of partially thaw FFP and centrifuge it and they sort of skim out this highly concentrated sludge which is specific factors that have been concentrated down.

- The Effects and Differences of Banked Blood vs Fresh Blood
  Key takeaways:
  - Banked blood is not the same as fresh blood in the patient's body, as it undergoes storage and is affected in various ways.
  - Additives, like diluents and preservatives, can have physiological effects on banked blood.
  - Citrate in the banked blood can bind up the patient's calcium.
  - Donors are screened to minimize risks.
  - Blood is tested for infectious agents.
  - Packed red blood cells in the US are often leukoreduced, removing most of the white blood cells.
  - White blood cells can contribute to inflammatory responses and mild graft versus host disease.
  - Many febrile transfusion reactions may result from white blood cells.
  - Most blood given nowadays is already leukoreduced.

  It's not the same. It's been stored and that does affect it. It affects the red cells, their pliability, their two, three DPG and their ability to, their affinity for oxygen, their pH is affected, but also we've added stuff, right? We've added diluent and preservatives and anticoagulants, so we've actually diluted all this stuff and what we've added can have physiologic effects. For instance, giving a great deal of the citrate and red blood cells can bind up the patients calcium. So just bear in mind that banked blood is not the same as fresh blood that's in your patient's body, even if you do your best to try to recreate that. Okay, let's talk about the process for matching these two patients. First of all, again, we screen donors to try to minimize any risks on their end. Then they do test the blood for a number of infectious things. Probably packed red blood cells, and this is fairly ubiquitous in the US here now, are lukeau reduced. They filter or wash out most of the white blood cells. You don't need these and they probably contribute to inflammatory responses in the recipient, kind of a mild graft versus host disease. A lot of the mild, febrile transfusion reactions we see are probably from white cells. So most of the blood you're giving these days for us is already lukeau reduced.

Another case is you can lukeau filtered out while it's being given. A more extreme version of this is irradiation, where you actually kind of bombard the blood with ionizing radiation to totally deactivate any of the lukeocytes that are there.
