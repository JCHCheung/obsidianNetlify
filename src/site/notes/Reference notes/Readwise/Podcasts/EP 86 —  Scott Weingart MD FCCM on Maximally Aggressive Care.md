## Highlights
- The Importance of Expertise in Emergency Medicine
  Key takeaways:
  - Amateur's talk strategy and experts talk logistics are important in emergency medicine.
  - There is a lot of depth to understanding how to make things work correctly in emergency medicine.

  Speaker 1
  And then when it actually had to happen, it goes horribly awry. And you know, I could just reel off, you know, 15 of these scenarios where things that are even more common that you're doing it on an everyday basis is consistently as if reinventing the wheel. There's an ad hoc nature to it that drives me insane. You know, one of the core things we do in emergency medicine that you talk about all the time, Dan, is simply putting in a breathing tube. And if you ever get to observe as a third party how this happens in a lot of emergency medicine, it's absolutely, you know, it's ridiculous that something lifesaving is being performed at a level of, oh, well, I guess, you know, we'll just find the stuff and we'll gather it all together and like there's no preplanning, there's no standardization. There's no capability of reflecting on success and whether there's the ability to optimize and all those things come down to the statement of amateur's talk strategy, experts talk logistics.
  Speaker 2
  First off, hell yes. Like, I strongly agree. And like, I think there's so much depth in there about like all of the, to go back to what we talked about in the first half of this episode, all of the individual team and structural components of making something like that work correctly, right? We're going to try to stay in the sandbox of the individual for the moment. So knowing that that's true, that amateur's talk strategy and experts talk logistics, what do we do with that other than noted?

- How to be an Expert at Failure
  Key takeaways:
  - Experts have planned out their routine for when things go wrong, and they have a plan B, C, and D in place in case of a failure.
  - It is important to have a mental stimulation and to envision what could go wrong before performing a procedure.
  - It is important to have degrees of failure in mind in order to be an expert.

  Speaker 1
  I have my own crico-therotomy set up so that I never have to worry about finding the 11 blade on the day that they just forgot the stock blades and the entire EDM or, you know, by that same token, if we continue that example, okay, they didn't stock blades. So where am I going to go to get one? And then you realize, okay, well, every single central line kit in the hospital, whether it's on a floor or not, is going to have the scalpel I need to perform this life-saving procedure. So now I built into my routine where I'm going to go if there's a failure mode. If something has not gone, I've had plan B, plan C, and I've logistically planned that out before things actually happen. And that's the key is everything that is mission critical. You should have a mental stimulation and envisioning and then throw in the monkey wrenches, throw in the hazards that are going to send you astray and then ask yourself again before it's actual in front of a patient, how am I going to solve this? What are my degrees of failure? And another thing we talk about on M-crit is what makes an expert is not how well you perform. You know, that's great. Everyone gets that. That's a gimme. Most people are performing at a high level and, you know, the expert will perform higher than the amateur, but that's not the real win. The real win of an expert is degrees of failure. Not only are they performing at a high level, but they actually have the ability to fail gracefully at point B, point C, point D, and they've already thought ([Time 0:18:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/674efa2f-c854-46c3-8ff2-a08e028f38a6))
