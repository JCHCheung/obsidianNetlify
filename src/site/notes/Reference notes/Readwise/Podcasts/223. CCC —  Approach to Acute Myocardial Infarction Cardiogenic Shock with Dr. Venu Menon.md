## Highlights
- Intriotic Balloon Pump
  Summary:
  We know that nothing good comes out of utilizing wasoppressors like dopemine or liverfed in this situation. In a patient like this who is coming into the lab needing was opressors support, my first thing is, how can i get rid of this was oppressor? And i'm hoping that along this way, you know, you'd mention the echo cardagram.

  Om it. So obviously enough for most folks who are encountering a patient like this and are not in the cat lab. They don't have anything else but vasopresse terapy to increase the blood pressure. And we know that nothing good comes out of utilizing wasoppressors like dopemine or liverfed in this situation, in that, apart from increasing the blood pressure, everything else is going in the wrong direction. Your increasing the heart rate. Your increasing escemia, your increasing ertmogenousity, your causing more perful vascular veso constriction, your increasing supply demand mismatch in all the vitalor s around the body. And so was oppressor use, in my mind, should be minimized and, if possible, completely avoided. So in a patient like this who is coming into the lab needing was opressors support, my first thing is, how can i get rid of this was oppressor? And i'm going to go on to support. And that's why i'm hoping that along this way, you know, you'd mention the echo cardagram. So i'm hoping my smart cardiologists, using a point of care ultra sound, had quickly just done a paristernal and an hypical foure chamber view and said, you know what, doctor, merin the arv function looks normal. There's wall motion ab normality in the anterior apex. I don't see any mar i don't see a pericartal effusion. There's no signs of a ventriclar septral rupture. If i knew that, i'd say, hey, this is pure, predominantly lv cardigenic shock from a large, acute anterior am i this person's l v is going to be elevated. They're going into pullmedema. It's only going to get worse. Let me decompress the left ventricle. And i got two choices, the intriotic balloon pump and the impeller. I just need left sided support. From all the data that's come out from the i a b p shock to trial and other trials, we know that the s of an intretic balloon pump in this situation is not associated with a dramatic improvement in mortality.
