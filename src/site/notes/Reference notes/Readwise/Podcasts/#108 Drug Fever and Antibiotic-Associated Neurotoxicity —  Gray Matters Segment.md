## Highlights
- Stopping Antibotics Could Be Harmful
  Summary:
  If there's an infection that can produce sepsis, it would be very likely to be found by the methods we have. Doctor stad: Think about your patient's trajectory and does it fit with what we'd expect from a typical infectious time course? "They kind of look clinically a little bit better than i would expect them to look," she says.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  That
  Speaker 3
  point speaks to me a lot. If there's an infection that can produce sepsis, it would be very likely to be found by the methods we have. I
  Speaker 1
  agree, it makes so much sense when she says it, but in the moment, it is so hard to pull myself away from thinking that it must be sepsis. And i often get really worried about stopping the antibatics, because even if i haven't found an infectious source, there's still this nagging in the back of mind that what if i did miss something, and stopping the antibotic could be harmful. So i asked doctor stad, and her big takeaway is to think about your patient's trajectory, and does it fit with what we'd expect from a typical infectious time course in
  Speaker 2
  the situation where you've started treating somebody, and maybe they got a little bit better from the infection. They had a that you were treating, and then suddenly they start to take a turn for the worse. And maybe the fever comes back, or the white count that was going down, it starts to go up a little bit again. But over all, they kind of look stable. And you're doing an additional search, and you're not finding anything. That's kind of a situation where i start to think about it. Maybe it's the patient with the fever and the white count, but actually they kind of look clinically a little bit better than i would expect them to look if they had an infection that was getting worse over time.

- Drug Fever
  Summary:
  There 're a lot of different drug classes that can cause drug fever. The beta lactam drugsand s, the whole class, its penicilan cephalis, borns, carbopeums. Some of the tetrcyclines and mino cycline are also more likely to cause drug fever than others.

Maybe it's the patient with the fever and the white count, but actually they kind of look clinically a little bit better than i would expect them to look if they had an infection that was getting worse over time. That's another setting where i might think about it. So
  Speaker 1
  that time, race didn't really fit with my patient, because, if anything, she was doing a little bit worse again. She's now in the i cu. She's on pressers. So then i start looking at her medlist, and i'm wondering which medication should i be focusing on as culprits for drug fevers? So
  Speaker 2
  there 're a lot of different drug classes that can cause drug fever. Among the anti microbils, the most likely drugs to cause drug fever are by far, the beta lactam drugsand s, the whole class, its penicilan cephalis, borns, carbopeums. Any of them can cause drug fever, and its wagh more likely than a lot of the other classes. Some of the tetrcyclines can cause drug fever as well, like mino cycline, ah, but generally those are the ones much more likely to do it than others.

  Speaker 2
  Generally, you'll have a lot of other information at the tip of your fingers that might help guide you toward drug fever or drug reaction, as opposed to infection. And so those would be things like looking for m a rash, because sometimes these are hyper sensitivity reactions. And so probably in about a third or more of cases, you might find some kind of a rash there that's going to help you. Or maybe you'll find an eosinaphylia. You know, maybe the team has seen that lucocytosis in the c v c, but they haven't thought to send a diff for the last week.

And suddenly you realize, oh, there's 18 % eosin pils there. An that's what the white count of 20 was all about. And that sends you down a completely different road. Maybe the l f ts are climbing, or they've got a little bit of a new a k i, which, you know, you've been explaining away from hypotension, ah, but maybe they're having some end organ manifestations of a more serious drug type reaction. Ok, so did any of the things
  Speaker 3
  doctor stead mentioned come into play? Like, did
  Speaker 5
  she have any other signs that this could be a drug fever as a postacepsis? So she was a miropenum, which is a bata lac tam. She was not on any antileptileptic. ([Time 0:08:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b0e8a832-6e26-4ece-a44e-315035e67ed9))
- Antibiotic-Associated Eratoxicity
  Summary:
  Sphapine is the first anibiotic that comes to mind when we talk about antibiotic associated eratoxicity. Elactiums can cause mental status changes in sephalopathy. That is not unique to sephapim at all. We don't know if this really is antibiotic associated nrot toxicity. And so that's why i wanted to talk about this for our second deep dive.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 5
  And she was still intimated because of her altered mental status. How are you even assessing hour mental status? I thought you said she was intimated. Ye,
  Speaker 1
  great question. Because we usually do have our intimated patients on sidation. But he was so obtunded and not interactive that she actually wasn't requiring any setation. Oh,
  Speaker 5
  so
  Speaker 3
  what we you gos thinking for the alterd mental status? So
  Speaker 1
  we did the standard work up of altered mental status, you know, scaned her head, ee g treated her hepatic ancephylopathy, the whole nine yards. And then we raised the possibility of antibiotic nero toxicity. And i feel like this always gets raised on rounds, but then i don't know. I feelik i don't now what to do about it, or how to sess out if this really is antibiotic associated nrotoxicity. And so that's why i wanted to talk about this for our second deep dive.
  Speaker 8
  Ally,
  Speaker 3
  i know you said she was on miripenum, but i feel like the first anibiotic that comes to mind when we talk about antibiotic associated eratoxicity, for me, i's saphapine. I think
  Speaker 2
  what's important to remember when you start to go down the sapapine rabbit hole is that, um, that all be it. Elactiums can cause mental status changes in sephalopathy. That is not unique to sephapim at all. ([Time 0:13:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8952af00-1455-4d00-906d-43e61d0a2d46))
- Sephapian Ero Toxicity
  Summary:
  The spectrum of kind of seonus tox they can get from supapim is anything from just kind of global mental status change and suphilopathy. Often myaclonus is described for reasons that i don't think are very clear, and then non convulsive status epileptics. But what's been very characteristic of all the reports of sephapian ero toxicity so far is that there is a very particular group of patients in whom it seems to arise.

  Speaker 1
  And
  Speaker 2
  basically, the spectrum of kind of seonus tox they can get from supapim is anything from just kind of global mental status change and suphilopathy. Often myaclonus is described for reasons that i don't think are very clear, and then non convulsive status epileptics.
  Speaker 1
  I did not realize just how broad the spectrum actually is. Broad
  Speaker 3
  the spectrum.
  Speaker 5
  On top of that we're thinking of it. And
  Speaker 3
  think about all the times i've considered sephopim neurotoxicity, it's never clear cut, because if a patient as started on sephopim, by definition, there's a lot going on with them, a lot going in, a lot going out. So it's never as clear cut as, oh, we started sephopim two days ago. They got altered, we
  Speaker 2
  stopped it, they got better. Case closed. But what's been very characteristic of all the reports of sephapian ero toxicity so far is that there is a very particular group of patients in whom it seems to arise. And those are older patients, patients who have underlying renal problems. Their not metabolizing the sephapima, as they should, and often have not, been dose reduced relative to their degree of kidney um insufficiency. A, and patients with prior underlying cn s disease to begin with. So you know, that poor substrait, that probably makes them at more risk for a complication as ([Time 0:15:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c6289d21-c18b-432a-b97d-d1817321392b))
