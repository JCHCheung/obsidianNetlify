## Highlights
- Lactate in Sepsis
  Summary:
  Ogay woll listen, maybe those two people would like to now know about how we're going to apply all this new found knowledge to the patients in front of us. Well, let's start out by just reassuring ourselves that it's really worth knowing that venus lactat levels are equivalent to arterial so there's no need to be performing arterial stab sand other painful procedures to our patients just to find out a correct lactate level. So that's a nice one just to keep in the back of your mind. Ha ha ha ha ha  ha ha ha ha lactates could actually be extrapolated back from understanding all those cand of patha physiological pathways that we've

  Well,
  Speaker 1
  you know, tha risk of patting myself on the back again, that is exactly why i love physiology, because that's all of those reasons for rays lactates could actually be extrapolated back from understanding all those cand of patha physiological pathways that we've just discussed. So love it. Excellent stuff. The
  Speaker 2
  question's going to be, for the couple of you out there listening, he's going to be a patho physiology person, or he just going to remember lacktates? Im pretty sure which one i'm going to go for. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha, oh,

- Is Lactate Raised a Predictor of Mortality?
  Summary:
  understanding arobic and anarobic metabolism can be pretty useful. Lactate properly forms part of the assessment of most acutely unwel patients. A venus sample has got the same clinical utility as an arterial sample. And remember that nic lactates to help you remember the causes of raised lactates, in case you can't quite remember all that patho physiology when you're signing that blood gas.

  Or whil lovely way to finish, we all agree say that brings us to a close. So in summary, then understanding a bit about arobic and anarobic metabolism can be pretty useful when it comes to lactate. Lactate can get a pretty bad name in some points, with lactate equal sepsis. But it isn't all bad. Actually, can actually be useful to tissues like the heart for energy production. But a raise lactate may be a predictor of increased or caused mortality. So if you note it to be raised, you need to have really to think about why it is raised. Lactate properly forms part of the assessment of most of our acutely unwel patients. And a venus sample has got the same clinical utility as an arterial sample. And remember that nic lactates to help you remember the causes of raised lactates, in case you can't quite remember all that patho physiology when you're signing that blood gas. And if all else fails, and if you're lost, or actually, just to ensure you cover all bases, using a structured approach, like the one published by anderson in 20 14, looking at restoring tissue profusion, treating tissue ascemia, reversing offending agents, considering thim indeficiency, preventing ongoing unneeded anarobic activity and considering metabolic derangement is a great approach to those patients with the hyper lactitema amages, we should probably say, check it once.
