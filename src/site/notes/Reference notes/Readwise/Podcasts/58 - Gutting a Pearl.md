## Highlights
- Ferrosemide Absorption in the Small Bowel
  Summary:
  The absorption of ferrosemide is very variable, both between patients and in the same patient based on time. There's some data suggesting that there's greater absorption in the duodenum in the proximal small bowel than in the stomach. So this anatomic difference has relevance to the real reason why there might be a difference in the congested and decongested states.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So I guess it sort of makes sense to start with understanding how ferrosemide is actually absorbed.
  Speaker 1
  So can you tell us about that? Yeah, I can tell you a little bit more about the anatomy of its absorption or side of absorption. I can't offer too much about the actual mechanics of it, but I think the site in the anatomy ends up being really important. So ferrosemide is absorbed both in the stomach and in the proximal small bowel. And there's some data suggesting that there's greater absorption in the duodenum in the proximal small bowel than in the stomach. And this point is something that we're going to return to later because this anatomic difference has, I think, relevance to the real reason why there might be a difference in the congested and decongested states. Hmm.
  Speaker 3
  Okay. So ferrosemide is absorbed in both the stomach and the duodenum, probably a little bit more in the duodenum. And absorption is very variable, both between patients and in the same patient based on time. So the difference of if not, get a dema, then why absorption is so variable?
  Speaker 1
  There's definitely a number of factors that are going to play a role here. But I think I'll just mention one because it's highly relevant and that's food. So there's really good data that the absorption of ferrosemide is negatively affected by food intake. ([Time 0:03:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4440299f-02c7-4a73-a01b-a9a3b87461a9))
- Three Small Studies on Ferrosemide Absorption
  Summary:
  The first study found a little bit slower, lower peak. This finding was actually confirmed by a later study. They found little difference in the total absorption of ferrosemide between the compensated and decompensated states. And this idea that the total amount of drug being absorbed is the same in the two states? That's right. Okay, so what about that third study? It's actually very similar to the second. So they found no difference in the time to peak serum concentration, peak serum concentration itself, or the total Amount of Ferrosemide Absorbed. In fact, this is the largest trial of the three. It's still relatively small, only had 44 patients,
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, that's right. And this idea that the total amount of drug being absorbed is the same in the two states. This finding was actually confirmed by a later study. They found little difference in the total absorption of ferrosemide between the compensated and decompensated states. And in fact, this second study found no difference in the speed of absorption or the peak concentration. So the two things that the first study found, right, a little bit slower, lower peak, the second study did not find that. They found all the absorption seemed to be the same in the decompensated and compensated states. And in fact, this is the largest trial of the three. It's still relatively small, only had 44 patients, but still the largest.
  Speaker 2
  Okay, so what about that third study?
  Speaker 1
  It's actually very similar to the second. So the third study, again, compared compensated and decompensated states, and they found no difference in the time to peak serum concentration, peak serum concentration itself, or the total amount of ferrosemide absorbed.
  Speaker 2
  Okay, so to sum up, we have three small studies, all of which found that the total amount of ferrosemide that's absorbed doesn't decrease whether the patient is in a decompensation of their heart failure or not. One of the studies did show a delay in absorption and decreased peak plasma concentrations of the drug, but the other two actually didn't confirm this finding. So is that a fair summary?

- Is There a Difference Between Compensated and Decompensated Heart Failure?
  Summary:
  Some patients do appear to experience delayed absorption, even if an aggregate. So maybe some people would be more susceptible to decompensation. Did they have a sense of whether these patients were decompensated or have got edema? Could have led to any of the observed difference. I found absolutely nothing saying that gut edema is the key thing. Instead, many propose, and I think the best, evidences for delayed gastric emptying is being the culprit here.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I think it's a perfect summary. And in all Ed, one other interesting and important observation that all three studies made, and it's that some patients do appear to experience delayed absorption, even if an aggregate, they are appeared to me no difference. Like they all actually show this like, you know, patient eight, that patient eight, even if an aggregate in studies two and three, there was no difference. Patient eight seemed to have a delay in a decreased peak concentration. So again, getting into this idea that like, if ferrosemide is a weird drug in terms of its oral bioavailability.
  Speaker 3
  Got it. So that might maybe support this idea of this high variability in ferrosemide absorption, even at the level of individual patients, either within that patient or between patients. So maybe some people would be more susceptible to decompensation. Is that the case? Did they have a sense of whether these patients were decompensated or have got edema? Could have led to any of the observed difference? Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  So this idea that maybe for a subset of patients, the decompensated state affects the absorption. That I think if you look at the data, it seems to be a reasonable conclusion. But I found absolutely no data for this effect being due to gut edema, right? So that clinical parole of, you know, in decompensated heart failure, ferrosemide isn't absorbed because of gut edema. I found absolutely nothing saying that gut edema is the key thing. Instead, many propose, and I think the best, evidences for delayed gastric emptying is being the culprit here. Yeah.
