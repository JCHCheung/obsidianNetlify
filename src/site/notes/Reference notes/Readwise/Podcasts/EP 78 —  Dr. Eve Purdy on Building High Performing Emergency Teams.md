  I mean, so some of these unifying factors don't really come from me necessarily. There's this whole basis of teamwork science that helps us understand how teams work. So really one of the guiding theories that our team has used to understand teams and that has allowed us to see some of these similarities is called relational coordination. And this is a theory from Jodi Hoffer-Gatel that has been used across industries was actually developed in the airline industry. But interestingly, not in the kind of sharp aspect of aviation that we're used to thinking about in emergency medicine, so not kind of CRM, your plane's crashing. What are you going to do? Her question was actually, look, I see that there's this one airline that does an excellent job of getting their passengers to their destinations with their bags on time. And how does that happen? And why does that happen in one kind of company and not the others? So all of her research centered around that. And what she eventually came up with was this understanding that complex, interdependent work really is founded on three principles. Shared knowledge of what other people's roles are, shared goals, what do we want to accomplish in mutual respect. So an understanding that people bring something to the table that might be different than yours and that's of importance. And then all of this in the setting of communication that is high quality and timely. So really that core theory has allowed us to understand really how teams work.
