## Highlights
- The Impact of Ventricular Septal Defects on Follow-Up
  Key takeaways:
  (* A permenbronous [[ventricular septal defect\|ventricular septal defect]] is a type of ventricular septal defect that is located near the tricuspid and aortic valves., * Oftentimes, this type of ventricular septal defect can be closed off by the tissue from the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve., * These defects can often have no symptoms, and can often keep up with peers without any problems.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, Tommy, I'd love to tell you about our first case. So this is Samantha Smith. She's a 26-year-old woman with a known perimenbronous ventricular septal defect, who was previously followed by her pediatric cardiologist until she was lost to follow up when she went off to college. However, she was recently seen for a routine physical and was referred to adult congenital heart disease. Here she reports she's never had any symptoms, and as a child was able to keep up with her peers, no problems. She's continued to do well to this day without any complaint. Anu, does the type of ventricular septal defect impact the follow-up for these types of patients, and if so, how? Great question, Agnes. The type of ventricular septal defect does impact the associated hemodynamic consequences. The most common ventricular septal defect is a perimenbronous ventricular septal defect, which accounts for about 80% of VSDs and occurs in the membranous septum and can have both an inlet or an outlet extension. They are typically located near the tricuspid and aortic valves. Oftentimes can be closed off by the tissue from the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, and associated with abnormalities in the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, secondary to damage from the left to right shunt. This type of VSD can also be associated with an acquired form of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, ([Time 0:03:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c9dfd847-b009-4eff-b729-e810ddda2186))

They are typically located near the tricuspid and aortic valves. Oftentimes can be closed off by the tissue from the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, and associated with abnormalities in the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, secondary to damage from the left to right shunt. This type of VSD can also be associated with an acquired form of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, double chamber right ventricle, or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, or presence of a subaortic membrane formation, which we will discuss later. The best place on ECHO to see this type of defect is in the peristonal short axis at the base. Typically, you can see the VSD at a 10 to 12 o'clock position. The second most common type of VSDs are muscular type of VSDs, which are usually restrictive and can be multiple and usually close spontaneously by direct opposition of the muscular borders.
  Speaker 3
  Interesting. So in this context, restrictive just means a small VSD that restricts blood flow across the defect. ([Time 0:04:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/65f85169-812b-4c0c-954c-2e171e56e2cc))
- The Impact of a Ventricular Septal Defect on Cardiac Function
  Key takeaways:
  (* VSDs can be flow and pressure restrictive, and this is determined by the size of the VSD and the differences between the systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance., * Restrictive defects are those with high resistance to flow and permit only a small amount of left to right shunting, usually less than 50% of the ventricular output, or a QP to QS of less than 1.5.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Interesting. So in this context, restrictive just means a small VSD that restricts blood flow across the defect. But Anu, tell me how do we define whether a VSD is restrictive, and how does that impact prognosis and management for the patient?
  Speaker 1
  That's a great question, Tommy. VSDs can be flow and pressure restrictive, which is determined by both the size of the VSD and differences between the systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Restrictive defects are those with high resistance to flow and permit only a small amount of left to right shunting, usually less than 50% of the ventricular output, or a QP to QS of less than 1.5. By ECHO, we can doppler the flow across the ventricular septal defect to assess the velocity and gradient across the VSD. Restrictive defects will have a high velocity many times more than 4 meters per second, indicating a high gradient between the LV and RV. In restrictive defects, the RV pressure remains normal.

The pulmonary artery pressures and PVR is also normal, and there's a little increase in the ventricular stroke volume. When you have large defects that can be equal to or greater than the size of the cross-sectional diameter of the aortic root, oftentimes there's little resistance to flow, and they are sometimes called as unrestricted defects. In those cases, the pressure between the ventricles is equal, and the magnitude of shunt depends upon the relative pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance. As PVR declines, there is a large left to right shunt that generates an increased pulmonary blood flow, which results in increased pulmonary venous return and increase volume load to the left ventricle. And this left ventricle volume overload can result in left ventricular dilation and increase in diastolic pressure that can then cause an increase in your left atrial, pulmonary venous, and progressive symptoms of heart failure can develop. And over time, these patients can develop isomingur syndrome. ([Time 0:05:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b8b2f424-1278-4a2f-8b18-325a633d7382))
- The Right Coronary Cusp Prolapse: A Silent Killer
  Key takeaways:
  (* There are four types of defects that can be found in adults: Membrane, restrictive, progressive AI, and prolapse., * Membrane defects are the most common, and the louder the murmur, the more likely the patient is to have a restrictive defect., * Prolapse is an issue for these patients, and progressive AI is a common finding.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Thank you so much, Anu. I think that you're really laying this out clearly for everyone to understand. I would just reinforce what you said is that there are really are four types of defects. Membrane is being the very most common and restrictive being the most common finding when we diagnose patients in adulthood. We'll talk a little bit more about physical exam findings, but I think it's important to remember that the louder the murmur, the more likely the patient is to have a restrictive defect. And by definition, then that means that the flow actually isn't all that much. So even though a loud murmur often means a lot of pathology and other lesions in the setting of VSD allowed murmur actually is kind of a good sign. And we'll keep talking about that as we go through.
  Speaker 3
  So interesting, Anu, and just equating what we see at the bedside to what we're seeing on echo and what it actually means in terms of the clinical outcomes of the patient just brings it all together. Anu, one thing you talked about a little bit is progressive AI that happens to do a prolapse at the right coronary cusp, and it seems to clearly be an issue for these patients. Throughout the ACHD series, we're framing everything in terms of the structural abnormality, the hemodynamic consequence, and the clinical sequelae. Anu, what's the mechanism for AI in this context, and how is that usually addressed?
  Speaker 1
  The AI in this context is due to prolapse of the right or sometimes the non-cornerate aortic valve cusp. And initially that may result in a reduction in the degree to left to right shunting because that prolapsed cusp closes off the VSD, but over time that can result in the development of aortic regurgitation.

- ACCAJ Guidelines for the Management of Ventricular Subtle Defects
  Key takeaways:
  (* Aortic regurgitation is associated with ASD, and can be a sign of a ventricular subtle defect., * Valve leaflet damage increases the risk of endocarditis.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Thanks for mentioning that. I think it's really important to remind everybody that aortic regurgitation is associated with ASDs because of this venturi effect. It's often not terribly intuitive that somebody would have because of the flow through the VSD and really the high velocity flow pulling that lease then in would be at risk for aortic regurgitation. And because of that actually, it is an important part of the guidelines. I will direct all of our listeners to the ACCAJ guidelines published in 2018, and the really nice phone application that allows us to think through a flow chart of how we manage ventricular subtle defects, particularly with aortic regurgitation. And I like to remind everybody that progressive aortic regurgitation in the setting of a membranous or in an outlet VSD is an indication, although class two A, an indication for surgical intervention. The other thing I just want to also expand upon, which laid the ground up for nicely, is the fact that there actually is valve leaflet damage. And we all know that valve leaflet damage makes people slightly more likely to developing endocarditis. So that's another important component to see, particularly if you see a significant change in the aortic valve function, you have to keep in mind the fact that VSD patients may have a slightly increased risk of endocarditis.

- Different Types of Ventricular Septal Defects
  Key takeaways:
  (* There are different types of VSDs, membranous, muscular, and outlet VSDs., * Inlet type VSDs are also known as the AV canal type and can be seen in the inlet portion of the ventricular septum, immediately inferior to the AV valve apparatus., * AV canal defects or AV septal defects are the most common form of congenital heart disease in patients with Down syndrome.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Great, thank you, Dr. Shafer. I think you give such a nice overview here of the different types of VSDs just to review membranous, muscular, and outlet VSDs that we've talked about, and then this really important sequelae of AI. I think that we'll get into a little bit later. Any other types of VSDs we should be aware of, hopefully ones that don't come with a lot of other associated names. Yes, Agnes, the fourth category of VSDs are the inlet type. These are also known as the AV canal type, which occur in the inlet portion of the ventricular septum, immediately inferior to the AV valve apparatus. And this can be seen in the AV canal defects and can be associated with a common AV valve and can be associated with the AV septal malalignment and straddling. This is due to an endocardial cushion defect, and it's important to note that AV canal defects or AV septal defects are the most common form of congenital heart disease in patients with down syndrome. Rarely, patients can also have a separate type of VSD that's an LV ([Time 0:11:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5b10e972-3b51-4d73-8c13-9b00f636f852))

Rarely, patients can also have a separate type of VSD that's an LV to RA shunt that's known as a Gerbody defect, in which there's actually absence of the atroventricular septal tissue that results in an isolated left ventricle to right atrial shunt. ([Time 0:11:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/405cf8ea-b0f2-4cb8-a660-2852baba3074))
- The Importance of Ventricular Septal Defects in Adult Echo
  Key takeaways:
  (* Inlet VSDs are associated with a primem ASD, and can be difficult to see on chamber views., * Gerbody defects are uncommon, but can be caused by profound endocarditis or other conditions.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Really important points. I completely agree with your statements there. A couple of things I'd like to add. I think first is thinking about the inlet defect as being associated with a primem ASD. As you say, it's on the AV canal spectrum, but I just want to remind everybody that if you have a primem, atrial set to defect, you should immediately look for an inlet VSD because they're often associated with one another. And in all honesty, can be missed. It's very hard sometimes to see a very small inlet VSD in the setting of an adult echo. So it's really important to make sure on those apical for chamber views in particular that small color boxes with high frame rare placed over the ventricular septal. I think your description of the gerbody defects really interesting, particularly as it is uncommon, but really important to understand. In my experience in all honesty, the most common type of gerbody defects that I have seen actually is as a result of profound endocarditis sort of as an acquired ventricular septal defect. But really important to think about regardless of what type of patient we're looking at. And I really also want to just highlight your comment on the conduction system. I think your description is a really important one with regards to the fact that the conduction system location is not the same in patients with ventricular septal defects, particularly of inlet or as nimbranist defects. And this is important for a couple of reasons. I think number one, it's why we actually have to choose our surgeons very carefully. The ACCA, Jake Island, is actually specifically state that we need to have surgeons with ACHD training performing surgeries on patients like this. And this is one of the main reasons. The other reason I like to highlight it is because it's actually inlet VSDs and really primum ASDs are often associated with the left anterior for secular block. Not really expected in the setting of an ASD or a VSD, but it's because of this conduction system disease. ([Time 0:13:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e428fa0d-4da5-4aa0-90a5-7a3ebb983155))
- The Effect of Ventricular Septal Defect on Shunt Direction and Degree
  Key takeaways:
  (* The direction and degree of shunting in patients with membranist VSDs is determined based on their downstream compliance and resistance.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Great. Thank you so much, Dr. Shafer, and just to highlight again, I think it's great to kind of go through where the conduction system lives in relationship to various VSDs in helping us. So I think not only just memorize EKG findings, but really think about structurally why they may be impacted and why we're seeing really on ECG, these findings with different tips of VSDs. So thank you both for your review on that. Getting back to the patient and sort of back to our discussion about membranist VSDs, which are restrictive. Sam was previously reported to have a restrictive membranist VST with left to right shunt. And so, Dr. Shafer, what determines the direction and degree of shunting in these patients?
  Speaker 2
  Thank you so much for asking, Agnes. I think you know, this is one of my favorite questions to answer, and it's because it actually highlights physiology that we all loved when we were in medical school that sometimes forget in the practice of general cardiology. So the shunt is determined based on the downstream compliance and resistance. So in the setting of a ventricular septal defect, the majority of shunting is actually, as Otto actually mentioned ([Time 0:15:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f7035b35-e760-46fc-b815-074d6630c78b))
- The Importance of a Holocystolic Murmur in Ventricular Septal Defects
  Key takeaways:
  (* Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) can be heard with a holocystolic murmur and typically cause a holocystolic left to right shunt., * A louder murmur is not always a bad thing, as it can be indicative of a smaller VSD.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  It's fascinating just to see how the physiology drives function and drives what we're seeing with the patient. I'm just thinking back to my medical physiology classes before that, just physics classes, thinking about how fluid move in a system, and this is so great. And, you know, we're bringing it back to the patient again now based on this conversation about the shunt. What were the key features which we're looking for when we're taking care of this patient, particularly in regards to physical exam?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, Tommy, I think the physical exam cannot be stated enough in terms of the importance and understanding what are the features that we can see in ventricular septal defects. So VSDs typically cause a holocystolic murmur if the pressure in the right ventricle is lower than the left ventricle throughout systole, resulting in a holocystolic left to right shunt. Small restrictive VSDs will have a louder harsher murmur and they are typically holocystolic usually can be associated with the thrill and the third or fourth intercostal space along the left sternal border. And as Dr. Shafer mentioned earlier that a louder murmur is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it is indicative of a more restrictive defect. Muscular VSDs can have shorter systolic murmurs. If there is no holocystolic murmur or the absence of a VSD murmur with a loud P2 and RV heave, that's a marker of an elevated right ventricular pressures or elevated PVR and equalization of ventricular pressures. And these patients you have to look out for isomingur syndrome and they can also have other findings, including cyanosis and clubbing.
