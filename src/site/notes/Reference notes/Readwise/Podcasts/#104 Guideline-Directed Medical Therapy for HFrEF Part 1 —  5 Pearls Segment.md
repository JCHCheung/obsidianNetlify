## Highlights
- Bata Blocker vs Motopa
  Summary:
  At least three bata blockers do re mortality, which is a win at least. A meto analysis showed us that the largest effect on mortality is actually with carvata. There's the lack of beta selectivity that may have some other theoretical benefits. And then there's the fact that carvetaall tends to improve your insolent sensitivity.

  Speaker 1
  And
  Speaker 2
  so it's like an apples to half an apple comparison. Don't get me wrong, you're not supposed to prescribe matopa tartrate for patients who have a reduced dejection fraction, and by commenting on the weaknesses of the comet trial, iam not suggesting that you start prescribing it to your patients. But we should be aware, as li evident space physicians who are able to tolerate a little bit of nuance and uncertainty, that the only trial that was ever done comparing bata blockers was designed pretty clearly to show that one was better than the other, not to ask the question about which one was better.
  Speaker 1
  Wow. Mike drop, so i guess the thing that we do know is that at least three bata blockers, carvetala, motopa, saxony and basoperala, do re mortality, which is a win at least.
  Speaker 3
  And a meto analysis showed us that the largest effect on mortality is actually with carvata. You
  Speaker 1
  know, i wonder why that is, victoria, is it just that carvata acts both on beta receptors and alpha receptors? And these patients who are on carvata al just get more benefit because they have better blood pressure control. So
  Speaker 2
  for example, alpha blockade is going to lead ta increased afterload reduction. There's the lack of beta selectivity that may have some other theoretical benefits. And then there's the fact that carvetaall tends to improve your insolent sensitivity, whereas metopela and some of the other cardio selective bata blockers tend to worsen your insolent sensitivity. Really, you
  Speaker 1
  know, i don't think i appreciate that carvetaa can ([Time 0:05:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/aec5c19e-5094-445b-aca0-fc09ee42468a))
- The Pros and Cons of Beta Blockers
  Summary:
  In general, i prefer carvatala over metoperla, sucinate or bisoperla. The data shows that it's probably a little bit better with regard to morbidity and mortality long term. I like how doctor cats emphasizes here that we can start seeing some of these negative metabolic effects with metoprola.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Really, you
  Speaker 1
  know, i don't think i appreciate that carvetaa can actually improve insolent sensitivity in our patients, and more so, that other beta blockers actually contribute to insolent resistance. In
  Speaker 2
  general, i prefer carvatala over metoperla, sucinate or bisoperla. The reason that i prefer carvatala is twofold. One, i think that the data shows that it's, on the whole, probably a little bit better with regard to morbidity and mortality long term. Number two, i buy the incremental benefit that you get from improving ent sensitivity and the metabolic impacts of te bata blocker. Long term, potentially having some some negative consequences down the road, right? I like how doctor cats emphasizes here that it's really in the long run that
  Speaker 1
  we can start seeing some of these negative metabolic effects with metoprola. Saxony
  Speaker 3
  ye, i also appreciate hearing how he weighs the prosen cons. Let's also hear from doctor morawalla about which one she reaches for and when. So
  Speaker 4
  someone has border line blood pressure, more likely to reach for the metopraa. Someone who needs blood pressure lowering in addition to justte the overall beta blocker effects, will reach for the carbata. All
  Speaker 1
  ok, so now that we understand the pros and cons of some of the beta blockers, maybe the most important thing we can focus on is how we educate our patients on these meds and set them up for success. ([Time 0:07:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/34ff4683-b7ea-4b84-8876-4df17b5cbcd4))
- What Should We Be Watching Out For?
  Summary:
  In order to really up titrate these medications, you need the ability to order a basic metabolic panel and a basic understanding of what the side effects are going to be. And in that 90 to one ten range, it's really caalike case by case basis. Sometimes you need to back off on the diaretic dose because you're getting the additional natrioretic and thus diaretic effect from the scubitral portion of the drug. Yes, this is one of my favorite moves in heart failure clinic. It's really easy to forget that diaretics themselves don't have any mortality benefit. So if my patient appears otherwise eupalemic, i love cutting
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Ye,
  Speaker 1
  i think that makes a lot of sense. So say we do get our patients on one of these life saving meds that blocks aras system. And then the other thing we should be making sure we do is up titrating these meds as much as a kidney and the potassium can tolerate.
  Speaker 2
  In order to really up titrate these medications, you need the ability to order a basic metabolic panel and a basic understanding of what the side effects are going to be. And ther than that, anybody could do it. Ok?
  Speaker 3
  So as we're trying to up titrate these life saving months, what should we be watching out for? And
  Speaker 2
  so i'll have a soft cut off of a sistolic blood pressure under one ten, i'm sceptical about starting it. And a sistolic blood pressure under 90, i definitely won't. And in that 90 to one ten range, it's really caalike case by case basis. Sometimes you need to back off on the diaretic dose of the loop diaretic that someone's on, because you're getting the additional natrioretic and thus diaretic effect from the scubitral portion of the drug. Yes,
  Speaker 3
  this is one of my favorite moves in heart failure clinic. It's really easy to forget that diaretics themselves actually don't have any mortality benefit. So if my patient appears otherwise eupalemic, i love cutting back on the diaretic in order to make some more room for these life saving mens. It's
  Speaker 1
  a great, a great move. Victoria a, i love it. O gates, let's recap this section. ([Time 0:18:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f0554d9a-4306-4e6a-b83e-7a19dda3e852))
