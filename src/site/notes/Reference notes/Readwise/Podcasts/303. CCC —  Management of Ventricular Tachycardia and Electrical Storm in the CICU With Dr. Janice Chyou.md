## Highlights
- Episode AI notes
  1. In a fast and furious situation, transferring a sick patient to a higher level care setting with proper escort and monitoring is crucial. Understanding the patient's substrate and triggers is key in managing arrhythmia cases.
  2. For management of an arrhythmic patient, determining the cause of the arrhythmia, assessing the patient's substrate and trigger, and implementing necessary measures based on evaluation are crucial steps.
  3. Interrogating an existing ICD to assess if it has appropriately detected ventricular tachycardia is important. Evaluating the effectiveness of prior therapies for ventricular tachycardia and determining if shocks have terminated the tachycardia are also essential.
  4. Assessing the hardware, software, and lead functionality of an ICD system, optimizing electrolytes if necessary, and considering additional riskmate agents are important in managing ineffective ICD shocks. Ablation can be a favorable option for patients with electrical storms due to VT.
  5. Considerations in ablation treatment for VT include the approach to the heart, location of the lesion, patient's hemodynamic support and tolerance, and the goal of the ablation procedure.
  6. A patient with arrhythmias on antiarrhythmic therapy undergoing a heart transplant workup may require mechanical support for stabilization while waiting for the transplant. Monitoring for suction events and optimizing preload are important considerations. ([View Highlight](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/94f2f8a8-b5ac-46af-922e-a368d2d497bc))
- What is the difference between a fast and furious situation and an acute situation?
  Key takeaways:
  - VT is a sign of a serious heart condition and should be treated as such.
  - VT can be caused by a variety of factors, including heart disease and reduced ejection fraction.
  - VT can recur, which is a sign that the patient's condition is still not stable.

  So these are all things I'm rapidly considering. So this is what it considers of a fast and furious situation, right? With the guy who was pretty, young, pretty sick, you're thinking about a lot of different things all at once and thinking about getting him acutely to a much higher level care setting and sending the guides that a EV is absolutely the right thing to do. The question related to it is in what way he traveled to the EV. I certainly hope that he emblems was called. He was escorted by an emblets in a highly monitored setting and not just went on the street and tried to walk himself over. Thanks, Dr. Chu. That's a great kind of framework you laid out for us. I would think many of us are thinking of some of the same questions as well. And as you said, we're pretty worried about this patient. Can you talk us through what new onset recurrent VT means to you for a patient with these risk factors or more broadly, why do patients get VT? So you and us, this is a great question. So when we see someone like this, the phrase that come to my mind is thinking about risk factors is substrate. Electrophysiologists like to talk about substrate as to what's the material? Was it substrate that's in the heart that's presumably anitis for the issue? So in this case, this is a patient with a history of cabbage with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

- Management of an arrhysmic patient
  Key takeaways:
  - The first step in managing an arrhysmia patient is to determine the cause of the arrhythmia.
  - The next step is to determine the patient's substrate and trigger.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  So now that we characterize problem, I want to ask you what your first steps would be for this patient's management.
  Speaker 1
  I think importantly, the first step in thinking about how we approach a case like this is thinking about whether or not this is structure, how disease related, whether or not this is scar base, and so far, we check likely yes and likely yes. We have not been told whether or not the ventricular tachycardia is monomorphic. If it's a scar base related, quite often this can be a monomorphic VT directly stemming from a scar area. In some other patient, there may also be polymorphic VT, which may sample an electro like this array, ischemia, proorhysmic agent, and other triggers. A good way to like to think about arrhysmia patients in general is to think about a patient's substrate and trigger. And by substrate, we're thinking about again the material that can make the arrhysmia. ([Time 0:07:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/756f9754-47e4-45b6-aeb6-d3f439b175e2))
- Detecting Ventricular Tachycardia in an Existing ICD Patient
  Key takeaways:
  - The patient's hemodynamics are stable, so the team has some time to figure out what to do next.
  - The patient is being treated with an immunorone, which is helping to prevent an infection.
  - The team needs to interrogate the patient's ICD to confirm that the device is working correctly.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So this is very helpful. I think we hear again that he's back in the ED. He has monomorphic Vt that they have ascertained. I'm happy to hear that his hemodynamics are relatively stable, so that it buys you a little bit of time to sort out, and for us, have a quick discussion. I think for us here, knowing that he has an ICD, that comprised one of the key areas of management that we need to sort out better. The second thing is, for him, so far, he's being an immunorone as his medication. So let's talk a little bit more about what to do in patients who have existing ICD, who present with ventricular tachycardia. The very first thing that we ought to do, and this is something that we need to tell the ED to be ready for us, is this device need to be interrogated. I think this typically takes the form of the cardiology and the EP fellow, and potentially also the EP attending, all coming to the patient's bedside at once, and someone as sick as this, so that we have an understanding of what's going on with a defibrillator. You want to assess, with a prior Vt, you want to see whether or not the prior Vt's were appropriately detected. In a patient with an existing ICD, there are two things that are critically important as we interrogating the ICD. I classify these on one side assessing, and then the other side implementing. So what are we assessing? We are assessing to see if the device has appropriately detected ventricular tachycardia, and confirming that indeed, the rhythm triggering the shocks were appropriate, meaning that these were related to ventricular tachyorectomyac, ([Time 0:12:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b0961bef-cab4-493e-aed1-89405d195fbc))
- Detecting Ventricular Tachycardia in an Existing ICD Patient
  Key takeaways:
  - The patient's Vt is monomorphic and stable, and they are being treated with an immunorone.
  - The patient's hemodynamics are stable, so there is a chance to sort out the management of the ICD.
  - The device needs to be interrogated to confirm that the Vt is appropriate.

- Evaluating the Effectiveness of Prior Therapies for Ventricular Tachycardia
  Key takeaways:
  - AFib, nonphysiologic, sick nose, leaf failure, etc. can all be indicative of ventricular tachycardia, and that if the episodes of ventricular tachycardia are detected and the tachycardia is below the program ranges, the ventricular tachycardia can go on without machine intervention.
  - If the prior therapies have been effective, then the shock should have a clean break, terminate, and meet subsequent multiple alternate shocks.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  AFib, non-physiologic, sick nose, leaf failure, etc. So you want to ascertain that the therapies would deliver appropriately for ventricular tachycardia. You want to see that the primary episodes of ventricular tachycardia were appropriately picked up. The tachycardia was noted appropriately since the marker channels reflect those, or did the tachycardia not get detected or not get therapy because they were too slow. So remember, if the ventricular tachycardia is below the program ranges, the ventricular tachycardia can go on without machine program intervention. Then you want to see if the prior therapies deliver for the ventricular tachycardia were effective. You want to see if the shock had a clean break, did the shock terminate, did the shock meet subsequent multiple alternate shocks? We heard that this patient received multiple shocks. What's happening to clean? ([Time 0:14:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/845ed7f3-ed4e-474b-9edb-a7aaa97d6228))
- Effectiveness of shock therapy for ventricular tachycardia
  Key takeaways:
  - The patient's ventricular tachycardia was successfully terminated with shocks, but the shocks were not effective in terminating the tachycardia in the past.
  - ATP was not effective in terminating the tachycardia in the past.
  - The shocks were appropriately implemented.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Then you want to see if the prior therapies deliver for the ventricular tachycardia were effective. You want to see if the shock had a clean break, did the shock terminate, did the shock meet subsequent multiple alternate shocks? We heard that this patient received multiple shocks. What's happening to clean? Was your clean break each time, followed by a recurrence of the tachycardia of the VT? Or was it the same meeting that just kept up going and going and none of the shocks actually produced a clean break at all? We also want to know if ATP, which stands for anti-tachycardic pacing, if ATP was initiated, when the window was was at the programmable window to allow for ATP. So anti-tachycardia pacing, it's the I see these way of trying to outrun the arrhythmia. They can be programmed as bursts or ramps whereby the machine tried to outrun it, either as a burst, as some cycle length, as some will raise faster than a tachycardia, or as rim, where it progressively runs faster and faster and faster. We want to know whether ATP successfully terminated any of the ventricular tachycardia episodes, which by the way, for monomorphic BT can be quite successfully terminated with some ATP. Or what did the ATP actually inadvertently accelerated the tachycardia, made it even faster, or made it degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Then the other side of it, we want to understand whether the I see these therapies were appropriately implemented. ([Time 0:14:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f5a37d8b-34c9-45f3-b94f-6a77bf1cf0d4))
- ICD Shock: Evaluation and Management
  Key takeaways:
  - A thorough evaluation of the existing ICD is critical to the initial approach.
  - The patient's EKG and electrolytes need to be assessed.
  - If the ICD shocks are ineffective, further assessment may be necessary to determine the cause.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So that's phase one. So anyone with an existing ICD coming in with ICD shock, ICD therapy, and especially if known to be ventricular tachycardia, a thorough evaluation of the existing ICD looking at the assessment arm as well as implementation arm are critical to the initial approach. The second thing obviously is thinking about the patient. The patient has an amiodarone therapy at this point. And on top of the amiodarone therapy, what is that EKG looking like? What are the electrolytes looking like? And as we think about some of the prior discussion that we had in laying on the framework, whether or not the two TCs of concern, whether or not the electrolytes need to be optimized, and then following that, if the patient needs an additional NCA riskmate, what agents may be reasonable. So assuming that we've done a thorough evaluation, and it turned out that the ICD shocks were ineffective, we may need to further assess to see whether or not the hardware or the software or whether the ICD system itself is functioning normally, whether the shock impedance has been compromised, whether the lead is still working appropriately. ([Time 0:17:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/11ef9dd0-ab1e-4097-bc78-341bbace7748))
- ICD Shock Ineffective: Management
  Key takeaways:
  - If the ICD shocks were ineffective, further assessment may be needed to determine the cause.
  - External paths should be on and connected to a soul for a patient at high risk for recurrent ventricular tachycardia.
  - There are several options for treating ventricular tachycardia, but some may have negative side effects.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So assuming that we've done a thorough evaluation, and it turned out that the ICD shocks were ineffective, we may need to further assess to see whether or not the hardware or the software or whether the ICD system itself is functioning normally, whether the shock impedance has been compromised, whether the lead is still working appropriately. And if that's the case, external paths should be on and connected to a soul for this patient who is at high risk for having recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The other side of the management, so once that of the management has to do with upfront understanding and optimization of the ICD system, the other side of the management that's immediate and bedside involves NCA riskmate agent. So when we think about NCA riskmate agents, we need to take new account of patient's comorbidity, patient's history of other riskmia, patient team of dynamic underlying substrate, QTC, as well as plans for ablation. Amy Oderone is the first line agent that started with all VT treatment. Lidocaine has the advantage of being shorter acting, easier to turn out, an optimal for someone who is being T off with ablation. Procanomy is an option for ventricular tachycardia. However, may compromise blood pressure and be a social hypertension in the cute space, especially with IV procanum line.
  Speaker 3

- The Advantages of Ventricular Accordion Ablation for Patients With Electrical Storms Due to Incesus VT
  Key takeaways:
  - There is a significantly lower rate of the composite primary endpoint of just ventricular tech cardiostorm or appropriate ICD shot the mom patient undergoing catheter ablation compared to patient who received escalation antiarithmic therapy.
  - Inpatient with electrical storm due to incesus slow monomorphic VT, again, I was not given a tech accordion cycle length, i.e. the EP equivalent for a heart rate, a ventricular rate. So I don't know whether or not this is a slow monomorphic VT, but presumably this is a patient who was already being an amiodral therapy. So the VT circuits are ready a little bit slower. And then now he's coming in with electrical storm due to incesum VT. Let's say that his VT is a slow VT. Ablation would be quite advantageous over antiarithmic therapy owing to concern for further slowing the VT in an already sick harm and a difficulty of further adjunct optimization of ICD programming given a slow VT. So I think these two things both favor having this patient strongly consider as a strong candidate for ventricular tech accordion ablation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They were targeting all induced OVTs. With this study, they found that there was a significantly lower rate of the composite primary endpoint of just ventricular tech cardiostorm or appropriate ICD shot the mom patient undergoing catheter ablation compared to patient who received escalation antiarithmic therapy. So this population critically for this discussion actually also include a patient specifically with VT storm, albeit a small population, but it's certainly one of the inclusion criteria. Inpatient with electrical storm due to incesus slow monomorphic VT, again, I was not given a tech accordion cycle length, i.e. The EP equivalent for a heart rate, a ventricular rate. So I don't know whether or not this is a slow monomorphic VT, but presumably this is a patient who was already being an amiodral therapy. So the VT circuits are ready a little bit slower.

- Ablation Considerations in the Treatment of VT
  Key takeaways:
  - Ablation is a complex and critical process that requires careful consideration of patient factors, including hemodynamic stability and tolerability.
  - There are a variety of ablation techniques and strategies that can be used, depending on the location and severity of the lesion.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But there also additional consideration that we take in account when we think about ablation, and that has implications on the axis, how we get to the heart, where we do the vascular axis, and when we try to get to the ventricle, are we going transceptile, are we doing retrograde? And then in terms of the ablation area, is this endocardial ablation that we are planning, or do we need to consider epicardial approach? Where is the lesion? Where is the substrate, and where do we interpret a lesion to form? And in addition to thinking about hemodynamic support, which is critically important and continue to be evaluated throughout the case, that is how the patient is doing hemodynamically, is the patient tolerating the mapping and the induction of the VT. We also would consider what we call ablation and point, that is how much is enough, what are we going after? Are we simply going after the clinical VT that the patient presented in? Are we going after all the inducible VT? Are we doing a substrate modification approach whereby we feel that the patient is not stable enough for the VT to be induced in MAP, but instead we will assess the substrate of the myocardium and target the area that's most likely a risk loganic. I hope this gives you a good sense of the ([Time 0:29:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bb31d150-bcc7-44ec-adaf-e1a3d4673f10))
- The Importance of a Heart Transplant for a Patient with Antarhythmic Therapy
  Key takeaways:
  - A transplant workup is underway for a patient who required antarhythmic therapy, sedation, and prior ablation.
  - The patient is best served going to a heart transplant for his longterm care.
  - Mechanical support, such as impel initially or surgical VET, is appropriate for this patient.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, this guy has a quiet course. I'm very happy to hear that a transplant workup is underway. Heart transplant workups is very important, very appropriate for this patient at this point, who by the way, also sounds compliant with good social support. So he sounds like it could be a great candidate for that, but that obviously doesn't happen over at nine. So in the meantime, as you have summarized, this is a patient who had required antarhythmic therapy, sedation, and prior ablation. So where are we at? So the additional option that we may consider, but I think the big, big, big picture is this patient has been identified as being best served going to our heart transplant for his long-term care. Beering in mind, this is still a pretty young guy who at this point, I think, is five years plus two more years plus two more years, so still a little bit under 60. So still a pretty young guy. So one option for this patient at this point is certainly the help of a mechanical support. So mechanical circulatory support, if this patient would be quite appropriate, it sounds like at this point he already has a temporary LVET to stabilize him. He has subsequently also received our VET support. So for these patients, mechanical support is very appropriate, be it impel initially or surgical VET. In this patient, he sounds like he's heading toward the bivat path while waiting for the heart transplant. The key thing to watch out for patients will end up with an LVET. It's the nature of the volume. It's important to watch out for suction events, which can actually precipitate over chiglera recipient in the settings of not so optimized on preload. The other thing that's also really important as we think about ([Time 0:32:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e7409f1d-81c8-4661-9776-c0e7bf53d3e8))
