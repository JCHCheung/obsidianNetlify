## Highlights
- Hypoxemic Hypoxemia?
  Summary:
  The area with the clot is not the area that leads to hypoxemic. There are animal studies involving experimental palmnary embolism. Andtony, so this sort of a single avulous model with an acute embalus in the vessel feeding it.

  Andtony,
  Speaker 3
  so this sort of a single avulous model with an acute embalus in the vessel feeding it. That sort of presumes hat there is no pulmon an faction, that's right, which itself could sort of lead to, you know, a which, you know, which probably wouldn't, which wouldn't sort of mess up this model. Absoluteis, it's no questr to say. And could cause hypoema in that part of the land, ok? So earlier you mention that tha, you know, the area with the clot is not the area that leads to hypoxemic. And presuming there hasn't been apum ay infurction, and i think we know, you explain it really nicely. So the areas withwith really high v c are considered areas of essentially dead space, ventilation. And dead space itself doesn't typically cause hypoxemia. Instead, it locally t can lead to hyper capnia. And so i gess i don't think of pulmonary embolism is causing hyper capnia. So what's going on there? O
  Speaker 1
  cas, this is where i think it gets even more interesting. So there are animal studies involving experimental palmnary embolism. And in some of these studies, the animals are sedated and theyare mechanically ventilated, so they cannot alter their minute ventilation is kept fixed. And when this is done, and when they create an experimental p e, one of the first things they see is actually an increase in the pc o two, or hyper capnia. And so this is one of the key points, the increase in the pc o two is ond in the area where the clot is. And this makes sense, again, because the ventilation is great, but the profusion is zero.

- Hypoxemia of a Pea
  Summary:
  Lungs with clots have high v c, but they're not the cause of hypoxema. The areas without the clot experience an increase in flow or an inc increase in cue. So if we soom back into that unit with the clot, like, what's going to happen to t where? Where is it going to go instead? Is it shunting somewhere else?"
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  So we've been sort of zooming in on the area of the lung with the clot, and those areas, like you said, have high v c, but they're not the cause of hypoxema. And so we alluded initially to the other areas of the lung that are not affected by the by the embalus, are actually where the hypoxema of a pea can come from. So can you tell us about those? Yes.
  Speaker 1
  So if we soom back into that unit with the clot, now, given that the blood can't traverse that obstructed blood vessel, like, what's going to happen to t where? Where is it going to go instead?
  Speaker 2
  Is it shunting somewhere else? Yes,
  Speaker 1
  it is shunted. Though i would say, for our purposes it probably makes the most sense to avoid the word shunt, because it has specific onotations when we're talking about hypoxemia a it pos me shunt confuse xactly. Its being diverted to a different area. And if we go back to the animal models i mention earlier, the investigators found that the areas with clots had low c right? That's not surprising, right? They have an obstruction to cu. But they also found that the areas without the clot, the areas that don't have the p e, they experience an increase in flow or an inc increase in cue.

- Septic Pulmonary Ambolism
  Summary:
  There's no question there's going to be areas of adalectiis as a result of the pulmary ambolism. If you have a large enough p e, you might get shun across a p f o because of increase right side of pressure. There's a lot of layers to this. I think this gets to kind of a larger point, that what we're focusing on this episode is a singular explanation for hypoxyme and p e, but undoubtedly s going to be more going on.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Ok,
  Speaker 2
  tony, can i tell you about one situation i found where this may not entirely be the case, please?
  Speaker 1
  Which
  Speaker 2
  is bringing it back episode 14, my favorite, septic pulmonary ambuli. So this is like wildly observational. There is one case report in 19 96. It's actually an image of a vc scan in a patient with a small septic pulmonary ambulis. And what they saw was reverse vecumus matching or shunting in the area of the septic pulmonary ambolism. And they don't actually even comment on it. But i wonder if in that situation, at the sight of the clot, with like, you know, a lot of sighto kinds, sort of all the things that lead to imaging features we talked about on episode 14, you may actually get more local shunting and less diversion of blood.
  Speaker 1
  I think this gets to kind of a larger point, that what we're focusing on this episode is a singular explanation for hypoxyme and p e, but undoubtedly s going to be more going on. Right av already alluded to the idea of pulmonary an faction. There's no question there's going to be areas of adalectiis as a result of the pulmary ambolism. There's, if you have a large enough p e, you might get shun across a p f o because of increase right side of pressure. There. There's a lot of layers to this.

- Is it a clot releasing vasoactive factors?
  Summary:
  The classic finding for p e is to kipney. Most these patients have an increased mina ventilation, often driven by at least a part by a increase in respirary rate. So with an inotrope, with tein sing their cue, so they could get more hycoxa, yes, it's, it's totally am gosh, it's weird, but that's exactly right.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  clot. Eiter the v or the ventilation would be normal. It is, at least initially. But just as you said, ovia, what happens in patience with the c p e is they undoubtedly increase their a ventilation in response to the hypoxeme, in response to me be the local hyper capne, at least very early on. And so the classic finding for p e is to kipney. I mean, most these patients have an increased mina ventilation, often driven by at least a part by a increase in respirary rate. Now i want u to o apply this a little bit and imagine a scenari where a patient is presented with a massive pe with shock, and they're placed on a positive inotrope, like debutamine. So what might happen in this situation? More specifically, what might happen to their oxygen saturation in this situation? So
  Speaker 2
  with an inotrope, with tein sing their cue, so they could get more hycoxa,
  Speaker 1
  yes, it's, it's totally am gosh, it's weird, but that's exactly right. A. ([Time 0:15:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/952fea97-49e0-4df2-a49d-35a76570848d))
- Hypoxemia in a C P
  Summary:
  In acute pomeamblism, that blood is diverted away from areas of the clot. And this creates an increase in profusion without a matching of ventilation to these areas where the blood h's been diverted. All right, tony. Will you keelem up for us? Yes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Totally fascinating, tony, that this is sort of like one of those that's like hiding in plain sight, the sort of like you mention at the beginning thlike, oh, e, of course it p causes hypoxemas obstructive of course. And then, nope, that's not how it works. Ye,
  Speaker 1
  incredible.
  Speaker 2
  All right, tony. I know you have some tacome points. Will you keelem up for us?
  Speaker 1
  Yes. So in acute pomeamblism, that blood is diverted away from areas of the clot. So where i can use the word shunt, we'll just use the word diverted. And this creates an increase in profusion, or cue a, without a matching of ventilation in these areas where the blood h's been diverted.
