## Highlights
- Dosage Forms
  Summary:
  IV laryzopam can help with management of status epilepticus or an acute seizure type situation. The dosing that I typically see is usually no more than 1 milligram at a time, but it's more like 0.25 to 0.5 milligram. One thing to note about the IV formulation or the injectable formulation is some of them may have polyethylene glycol. That can cause some toxicity if a patient gets too much of that in their system.

  So naturally giving IV laryzopam can help with management of status epilepticus or an acute seizure type situation. Other dosage forms with laryzopam, most commonly I'm going to see used oral dosage forms, 0.5 to 2 milligrams are the dosage forms in geriatric patients. The dosing that I typically see is usually no more than 1 milligram at a time, but it's more like 0.25 to 0.5 milligram. Because younger patients you might see it pushed up a little bit, again depending upon what the indication is as well. So oral, again, tablet, most common dosage form. I mentioned the IV or injectable is available. That's 2 milligrams per mill and 4 milligrams per mill. And then there is an oral liquid called adenin tensile by the brand name there. And that is 2 milligrams per mill. So if you give somebody a fourth of a mill, so 0.25 mill, that's going to be equivalent to 0.5 milligrams. One thing to note about the IV formulation or the injectable formulation is some of them may have polyethylene glycol. And that can cause some toxicity if a patient gets too much of that in their system. ([Time 0:02:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eb51c25c-704b-42b8-b99c-ca03c504e557))
- Taking Lorazepam
  Summary:
  Most will start in the ballpark of probably 20 to 25% reduction. The nice thing about lorazepam compared to maybe diazepam or Valium for example, it doesn't have any active metabolites. That's particularly troublesome generally in geriatric patients.

  Most will start in the ballpark of probably 20 to 25% reduction. Now this can vary based upon patient experience, clinician experience, patient preference, what they want to do. But usually a ballpark reduction initially of 20 to 25% every one to two weeks is a reasonable place to consider starting anyway. You can certainly gauge how that's going by working with the patient and paying attention to them there. Pharmacokinetics, lorazepam is classified as an intermediate acting benzodiazepines. And with that comes a half life in the teens range. So 12 to 18 was the figure I saw listed on my research here. So that's not a crazy long time. The nice thing about lorazepam compared to maybe diazepam or Valium for example, it doesn't have any active metabolites. And that's particularly troublesome generally in geriatric patients.
