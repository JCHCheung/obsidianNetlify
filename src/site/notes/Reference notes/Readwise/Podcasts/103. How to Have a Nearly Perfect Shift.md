## Highlights
- Episode AI notes
  1. Happiness and freedom come from understanding what we can and can't control. As ER doctors, finding inner tranquility and outer effectiveness is crucial for a good shift.
  2. To improve your shifts, focus on raising your average and reducing variability.
  3. Preplanning is a helpful way to manage difficult situations.
  4. The fear of losing control is unfounded. The individual has a well-trained team who will help them achieve their goals.
  5. When faced with situations we can't change, we should focus on changing ourselves. ([View Highlight](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/a439fc2a-7777-4aa8-8f95-8aef12817620))
- The Circle of Control
  Key takeaways:
  - We get frustrated because we want to do the right thing, but also sometimes it comes out of not wanting to feel powerless.
  - We get frustrated because we want to control these things, but we feel powerless.
  - We try to control things we can't and we relinquish control of things that we can.
  - We give away control of our own emotions or our own thoughts and we allow other people to unduly influence them.
  - We need inner tranquility and outer effectiveness to be happy and free.

  We get frustrated because we want to be able to do the right thing, but also sometimes it comes out of not wanting to feel powerless and we get frustrated because we want to control these things. And yet we feel powerless. And what's so ironic about thinking about that circle of control is that we try to control things we can't and we relinquish control of things that we can. So we bang our heads against reality, trying to change things we can't. And yet we give away control of our own emotions or our own thoughts and we allow other people to unduly influence them. Now, you know, I can't go too long talking with you, Rob, without throwing some stoic quotes in there. So I've got one of my favorites here, which is from Epictetus. And he wrote, happiness and freedom begin with a clear understanding of one principle. Some things are within our control and some things are not. It is only after you have faced up to this fundamental rule and learned to distinguish between what you can and can't control that inner tranquility and outer effectiveness become possible. And man, as ER doctors, do we need some inner tranquility and outer effectiveness, right? Like what makes a good shift? Hey, inner tranquility and outer effectiveness.

- Before, During and After: A Guide to Making Better Shifts
  Key takeaways:
  - Shifts can vary a lot from day to day, and this can affect how well someone performs.
  - There is a standard deviation to how much a shift can vary, and this can be lowered by making them more consistent.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I don't know if you've noticed, Rob. We know each other pretty well by now, but I'm a little bit of a nerd. And so I think of things in terms of graphs and very quantitatively. So imagine you drew a graph of each of your shifts and you plotted on the vertical axis how good it was, maybe on a scale of one to 10 or whatever scale you want. Logarithmic, exponential, it's fine. It's all good. And you plotted out your shift. You would have some variation day to day, maybe some that are really bad, maybe some that are great, but it would kind of average out to an even line. And there would be some variation. So that's your standard deviation. How much day to day do your shifts vary? So when I was thinking about this and thinking about how can I make my shifts better? Because that's the goal. I want to feel better. I want to be better. I want to do better. I want to be more present. My definition, always 50% of my shifts are going to be below average. But the question then is where is your average? So you're going to have shifts that are below average, but what can you do to raise your mean? And then also what can you do to even out your standard deviation, meaning less variability shift to shift so that you don't walk in thinking is today going to be great, is today going to be terrible, but having more control so that you have less variability. You kind of know what you're getting into for the most part because you're the one bringing it. How does that work as far as executing it? I think of this kind of as a before, during and after.

- Mental Contrasting: How to Deal with Difficult Circumstances
  Key takeaways:
  - Preplanning is a helpful way to manage difficult situations.
  - Mental contrasting is a process of identifying and addressing obstacles that are outside of one's control.
  - Implementation intentions are a tool that can help to make difficult situations easier to manage.

  Speaker 1
  And this has been studied in all sorts of things from getting people to go out and vote, weight loss, time management, study skills, all sorts of different arenas. And it's very successful. So you anticipate what are the inner obstacles that I'm going to encounter. So not outer obstacles, not like other people, not coronavirus, not your department, not the nursing facility staff. But what inner obstacles are you going to encounter and then create a when then statement? So when I feel frustrated about X, then I will do Y. Or when I feel myself spiraling out of control and getting crazy busy, then I will do such and such. Or when I feel this problem, then I will do such and such. So pre-planning. And it could be things like you've mentioned. When I feel myself getting frustrated, then I will remind myself to be present. When I feel myself getting annoyed, then I will draw a circle and put what is in my control in that circle. So those kinds of easy things are things that you can pre-plan for and then start to create as a habit during your day. And then afterwards, when you look back and you say, was that a good or bad shift? Owning that. If that was a bad shift, that's on me. If that was a good shift, great. Maybe that was on me too. Maybe who's on other people. But taking ownership of that rather than saying, oh, this was a bad shift because of that person. Or this was a bad day at work because of that external circumstance.
  Speaker 2
  Let me walk you through a few things outside of my personal control that really affected me negatively. And how could I develop that?
  Speaker 1
  What did you call it? It's called implementation intentions. And the process is called mental contrasting with implementation intentions. And we can put a link to it. ([Time 0:21:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1b0edb38-c6c9-49d3-ae4d-ca02b03df68f))
- Fear of Failure: How It Limits Your Potential

  - The fear of losing control is unfounded.
  - The individual has a welltrained team who will help them achieve their goals.
  - The fear of failure is unfounded.

  That's not going to happen because I'm going to get it done. Undergirding my actions during every shift is years of training and continual training maintenance and improvement. So the reality is that the skill level could not be higher or sharper. Yeah.
  Speaker 3
  Hey, oh, I'm going to go. Is that good?
  Speaker 1
  So the thing that we're worried about is that everything's going to, you know, go to hell in a hand basket and we're going to lose control of our department. But that's not going to happen because as you said, you're well trained. You know what you're doing. It's not going to happen because I can work hard and run around on roller skates if I need to to make sure that I can do everything. It's not going to happen because I'm going to maintain my calm and sense of presence, even if we're running a code and I'm going to make sure that my team clearly communicates.
  Speaker 2
  So I've got a team. And I've got a team, right?
  Speaker 1
  Exactly. This is not going to happen because I have a team whom we're going to work together and get this done. So it's just kind of a neat way to think about what am I actually afraid of and what are the barriers to that happening?
  Speaker 2
  I love all of this just exists in your own mind. There's no tech or hack you need to buy. ([Time 0:29:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/407dc6a1-3978-4c58-9655-77d27f67ea91))
- The Power of Intentions
  Key takeaways:
  - Everything depends on our ability to change ourselves.
  - We can only change ourselves.
  - We must create space between stimulus and response in order to change our thoughts and create new realities.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes, exactly. This is really the crux that everything else depends on. And you quoted Victor Frankle earlier, but one of the other quotes that he has that I just love from his book, Man Search for Meaning is when we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves. So when we're in those situations of feeling powerless, I can't change this external circumstance. The only thing I can do is change myself. And of course, that's the main thing that we must do. So the way that we do that is all the things we've been talking about, creating space between stimulus and response, becoming aware of our thoughts, creating cognitive distance between ourself and our thoughts by looking at our thoughts and saying, okay, that's a thought. That thought of everything's going to go to crap and everything's crazy right now. That's just a thought. That's not reality. I can create a new thought, which will create my new reality. And you know, one of the things that I've really been thinking about a lot, Marcus really is one of his famous quotes is The Obstacle is the Way, or that's how it's paraphrased. But really, can I share this for you? This is so good. I want to share the whole quote. Do you ever read things? Oh, I just got goosebumps like good goosebumps. It's so good all the time. So he says our actions may be impeded, but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions because we can accommodate and adapt so we can change.
