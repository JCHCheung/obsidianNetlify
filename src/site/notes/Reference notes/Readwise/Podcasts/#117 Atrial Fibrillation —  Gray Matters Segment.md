## Highlights
- How to Diagnose Atrial Fibrillation in a Brief Telemetry Window
  Key takeaways:
  - Clinical atrial fibrillation can be diagnosed with either 30 seconds of telemetry or a full 12 lead EKG.
  - The duration of a fib can be an indicator of its clinical importance.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, yeah. See that that's where the first challenge came in. There's only about two or three runs of about 10 to 15 seconds on telemetry that had alarm for a fib. When I saw it, it was just hard to make out anything. Very erratic baseline. I mean, if you told me she was just brushing her teeth, I would have believed you constant struggle with a fib.
  Speaker 3
  And you know, the challenge is that once a fib is on the chart, it almost never comes off and it has so many implications for the patient.
  Speaker 1
  I know. So I'm sitting there wondering what to say to the resident on consults with me, not to mention the primary surgical team still waiting for an answer. I mean, was this a fib? How clinically important is something that brief? So for our first deep dive, I really wanted to explore how do you diagnose new atrial fibrillation? What can the duration of the fib actually tell you? So I sat down with Dr. Pooja Jagadha to talk about some of the takeaways for a recent article of hers on postoperative atrial fibrillation.
  Speaker 8
  The definition of clinical atrial fibrillation to diagnose is either 30 seconds on telemetry or some sort of wearable like an Apple Watch or equivalent device like EMA, Cardia, or a full 12 lead EKG. ([Time 0:02:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cecb9b0b-2cb8-4382-b8da-27c8bbf67a66))
