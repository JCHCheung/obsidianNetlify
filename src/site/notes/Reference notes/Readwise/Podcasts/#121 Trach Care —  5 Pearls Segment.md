## Highlights
- The Different Types of Tracheostomy Tubes
  Key takeaways:
  - There are a few trach manufacturers out there, but the two that are most commonly seen in the medical community are Shiley and Portex.
  - The outer cannula is what you see on the front of the neck, and it attaches to a flange or face plate.
  - The inner cannula is the smaller tube within the outer cannula, and it's removable for easier cleaning.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's quite a few trach manufacturers out there, but the two that we see most frequently, at least in my shop, are Shiley and Portex. So it's helpful to have that information ready when you're troubleshooting with your friendly neighborhood respiratory therapist or your pulmonologist.
  Speaker 3
  Yeah, I guess that makes sense. So why don't we go through some more trick parts. You mentioned outer cannula. What is that?
  Speaker 2
  There's this thing called the outer cannula, which attaches to a flange or face plate. This is what you see on the front of the neck, the face plate often as to strap or sutures that hold advice.
  Speaker 1
  Okay, so the outer cannula is what we see on the outside and what we think of as the tracheostomy tube itself. It's connected to a flange, which is rich with details about the trache. Honestly, guys, they used to look like hieroglyphics to me, but now I use them all the time because at a glance, I can tell the size, the manufacturer, and the presence of that telltale pilot balloon that lets me know the trache is cuffed.
  Speaker 2
  There's also an inner cannula. So it's basically a tube within a tube, a rigid tube with a slightly smaller tube inside it.
  Speaker 3
  Right, so the inner cannula clearly goes inside, but why do we need that inner piece?
  Speaker 4
  Shraya, the inner cannula is the underdog of trache tube components. That inner cannula is removable, which makes it much easier to change when secretions build up. And this way, you avoid having to go through a full trache change. ([Time 0:06:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/21730ae0-0b09-4138-87a7-65e69d55c986))
- TRAKE CARE: Figuring Out Why Your Patient Has One
  Key takeaways:
  - When a nurse page comes in asking for a doctor to come look at a patient who has a trake, the doctor should first try to figure out why the patient has the trake in the first place.
  - Depending on the reason the patient has the trake, the doctor may need to manage the trake differently.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 4
  Okay, now that you understand the different parts of the trake your patient has, let's say you get a page from the nurse that your patient with a trake does not look well. And he thinks something is up with the trake and wants you to come take a look.
  Speaker 3
  This is probably the scariest part of trake care for me and probably many other people because my brain just like draws a blank. To remember anything from one of those trake complication lectures I got way back when.
  Speaker 4
  And in that moment of brain going blank, we just got to take a step back and remember, context is key. The very first step is to figure out why they have the trake in the first place.
  Speaker 2
  The most common is somebody who has an endotracheal tube in and we're trying to get them off of the ventilator. There are also people who have a chronic need for mechanical ventilation. So people with neuromuscular weakness where they don't have good control of their respiratory muscles.
  Speaker 1
  Okay, okay, so we manage trakes differently if someone is vent dependent. And if I'm trying to figure out why my patient has a trake, the first place I look in the chart is their respiratory flow sheet to see, is this patient 24 hour event dependent.
  Speaker 4
  Right, because if your patient is on the vent 24 seven, like say someone with horrible neuromuscular ([Time 0:13:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fa898558-9862-46c1-8867-16c823ac7ca3))
- Accidental Decanulation: A Complication of Vent Dependent Tracheostomy
  Key takeaways:
  - It is important to think about when a vent dependent tracheostomy was placed.
  - A mature tracheostomy is one where the tract has epithelialized, which usually takes about five to eight days.
  - You can feel safe manipulating or exchanging the trache once it's been in for two weeks or so.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 4
  Now, another important branch point to kind of throw into the mix. And in addition to thinking about if their vent dependent or not, we also have to ask ourselves when that patient's trache was placed. And if it's considered an early or a mature trick.
  Speaker 2
  So that first trick will be in for, let's say, 10 days, just two weeks, and then the service or the person who placed it will come to the bedside and they will exchange it. After that, after that first exchange, pretty much anyone can manipulate it. Because at that after that point, it's considered to be a mature tracheostomy.
  Speaker 1
  So in other words, a mature tracheostomy is one where the tract has epithelialized, which usually takes about five to eight days, but you can feel safe manipulating or exchanging the trache once it's been in for two weeks or so. And you should still check at your institution because there's probably a safety policy about those tracheostomy changes, and each place handles it a little bit differently. For example, at my hospital, my quick and dirty is to look for sutures, which come out around day 10 as an indicator of trache maturity.
  Speaker 4
  That's a pretty neat trick. And so with that set up of thinking whether a trick is early or late, let's start to tackle some of our three major complications. The first one on deck. Let's say you're called to the bedside for an accidental decanulation, which is just a fancy way of saying the whole trache came out of the stoma.

- The Different Management of Trache Bleeding in an Early Mature Trache
  Key takeaways:
  - Changing the trache can be a mature person's way of rebooting their computer.
  - If someone has bleeding early, it is usually from small vessels or from the skin.
  - Usually, bleeding can be stopped with pressure and supportive measures can be taken if needed.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Wow. Changing the whole trache that I don't know about you guys, but it feels a bit invasive to me. But I guess if it's a mature trache, the tract of epithelial eyes, it should be OK.
  Speaker 1
  Right. I sort of think of this like rebooting a computer that isn't working, right? Something has gone wrong and I don't know how to troubleshoot it with the intercanula and suctioning. So it's just time to change the trache.
  Speaker 4
  OK, now for the nightmare scenario, our third big trache complication. You get a page that your patient has bleeding at the tracheostomy site.
  Speaker 3
  Let me guess, just like with accidental decanulation and obstruction, the management of bleeding probably differs based on if it's an earlier mature trache. That is correct.
  Speaker 4
  OK.
  Speaker 2
  If somebody has bleeding early, most likely that is bleeding from small from the skin or small vessels. Usually that can be stopped by just pressure. Sometimes that bleeding is not from the trache itself, but from the airway. So the person might have suction trauma. They might have some tracheitis. These are situations where generally on this will stop on its own with supportive measures. ([Time 0:21:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2c4ceda6-4e3e-463a-bbb6-0c292090aa9f))
- How to Stop a Tracheal Bleed
  Key takeaways:
  - If you see blood shooting out of a trache, the first thing to do is hyperinflate the cuff and try to manipulate the tube so that you can possibly tamponade that area of bleeding.
  - If that doesn't work, the only other thing to do is to remove the tube completely, which seems crazy, but to remove the tube completely and put a finger in the stoma to try to pull forward toward the clinician to try to clamp off that bleeding artery.
  - Meanwhile, of course, it's going to be a bloody mess. So someone has to then take over mask ventilation, of course, suctioning, suctioning the airway mask ventilation, and then, of course, intubation.
  - And then worry about the, then get them to the operating room immediate.

  Speaker 4
  So you're telling me that I can hyperinflate the cuff, and if that doesn't work, stick my finger in the trache site and pull forward to try and stop that bleeding? That sounds wild.
  Speaker 1
  Yes, well, you know, the bottom line here, Matt, is that in a tracheal, nominate, fishlet, you have to do everything you can to achieve tamponade for the bleed, because the consequences are dire, right? And so what works for one person might not work for everybody. ([Time 0:24:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7f39c9f7-c319-4a94-8529-d8c530b10969))
