## Highlights
- What Should I Do During Extubation?
  Summary:
  Preoperatively, what would you do during the intubation to make sure that that process of extribation identified is going to be difficult? What should you do? Ok, so when we talk about extribation, really it's a continuum of the whole anaesthetic plan. And then towards the end of the case, you have to review the patient's situation and all the other factors before you actually take the tube out. Then, as with any part of annesesia, you need to have a back up plan should extribation fail.

  And then therea new w e area. So patients whoar having laposcop surgery, ina, head down position for a long time, says a whisk of airway demer there there also at whisk of provins. So what we can talk about you will be really interesting, an pre operative preparation. What steps would you take preoperatively? What would you do during the intubation to make sure that that process of extribation identified is going to be difficult? What should you do? Ok, so when we talk about extribation, when we think about extribation, really it's a continuum of the whole anaesthetic plan. So we talk about making an instubation plan, don't we plan a, b, c, d, e and er. Should be the same for extrubation. Of course, you can't complete your extrubation plan until you get to the end of the procedure, because the clinical situation changes as you get there. So er, i think you have to, er, have an outline plan for extubation. And then towards the end of the case, you have to review the patient's situation and all the other factors before you actually take the tube out. And then, as with any part of annesesia, you need to have a back up plan should extribation fail. So in the original dask ide lines, they they said, i think there should be a plan in place to measure the to manage the airo from the start to the end of anaesthesia.
