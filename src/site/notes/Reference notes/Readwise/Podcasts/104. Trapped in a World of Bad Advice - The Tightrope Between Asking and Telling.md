  He is an author of many books, most recently a book called Humble Inquiry that both Paul June and I read. He's a very decorated man with a master's degree from Stanford, a PhD in social psychology from Harvard University. He's a meritist professor in the MIT Sloan School of Management and a great guy. So welcome Ed.
  Speaker 2
  Thank you.
  Speaker 3
  So tell us about this idea of humble inquiry. What is it?
  Speaker 2
  Well, the idea of humble inquiry is really to ask people questions to which you don't know the answer. Now why would that be important? Because I think the condition that I see in most organizations, particularly around the safety issue, is that in a hierarchy, people tend to tell things rather than to ask questions. And the consequence of that is subordinates who know stuff about particularly safety or poor quality have no incentive to tell the doctor or the boss that something is wrong. So we keep doing damage because the boss says, well, why didn't you tell me? And the answer is you never asked. And whenever I tried to tell you something, you didn't listen or you even punished me for bringing bad news. ([Time 0:13:08](https://share.snipd.com/snip/739bb742-5a15-4b6e-86a2-972fa17bca8d))

  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker first learned about helping others while working as a consultant for Digital Equipment Corporation.
  - As a consultant, the speaker discovered that helping someone involves asking a lot of questions and allowing them to frame the problem.
  - Clients often appreciate being listened to and asked questions instead of being told what to do.
  - Building better communication trusting relationships is an important goal.

  Speaker 2
  Well I figured it out first as a consultant working with companies and noticing that when I tried to make recommendations or tell people how to run a group better, my first client was Digital Equipment Corporation, this very aggressive startup building mini computers and stuff. And they were a bunch of engineers who didn't want to be told what to do, but they wanted help. So I kind of learned that the way to help someone is to help them frame the problem and get them to tell you what's really on their mind. So as a consultant, I learned to ask a lot of questions and discovered that that way I knew in what way I could help. Sometimes by giving answers, sometimes just by reframing the issue and discovering that the client knew for himself or herself what they needed to do. And they thought it was very nice that I listened to them or asked them questions. People don't, when they say they need help, they don't necessarily mean they want you to tell them what to do. What they mean is they want a relationship in which they can talk. And that's where a lot of this is headed. Can we build better communication trusting relationships?

- The Power of Asking Questions
  Key takeaways:
  - Clients often value the process of talking and being listened to rather than receiving direct advice
  - People desire relationships where they can talk and be heard
  - Building better communication and trust is crucial
  - Asking the right questions is more important than asking more questions
  - Many questions asked are to test existing knowledge or are rhetorical in nature
  - Effective questions are those to which the asker does not know the answer

  Sometimes by giving answers, sometimes just by reframing the issue and discovering that the client knew for himself or herself what they needed to do. And they thought it was very nice that I listened to them or asked them questions. People don't, when they say they need help, they don't necessarily mean they want you to tell them what to do. What they mean is they want a relationship in which they can talk. And that's where a lot of this is headed. Can we build better communication trusting relationships? So that question of asking a lot of questions, the Emergency Department, we ask tons of questions.
  Speaker 3
  Every day we're asking a million questions, patients, nurses, everyone. When you talk in your book about asking the right questions. And so is it really just about asking more or asking right? And if it is about asking the right question, how do we do that?
  Speaker 2
  Well let's go back to definition, asking questions to which you don't know the answer. I think if you look at the questions people ask, nine out of ten, are testing something they think they already know, or they're just asking rhetorical questions, or they're asking a question in the form of a suggestion.

- The Importance of Humble Inquiry
  Key takeaways:
  - Start without assumption.
  - Develop a human relationship before obtaining necessary information.
  - Humble inquiry helps gather better information.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Bone. Start without assumption. And I have to develop, even though it's only maybe two or three questions, I have to develop a human relationship before I will get the necessary information on what's wrong and how to treat it. And to me, those are slightly different tasks. Humble inquiry is, let me get to know you a tiny bit. Not just your name, but where do you live? You know, what do you do? Are you in good condition? Those are more human questions. And it seems to me the reason for them is not humanity. The reason is to get better information.

- The Importance of Building Relationships in Medicine
  Key takeaways:
  - Curiosity is an important factor in becoming a better doctor
  - Building a necessary relationship is vital for practicing better medicine
  - A mindset of prioritizing the patient's well-being and their family's well-being is crucial for effective treatment
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And that comes out of curiosity and the recognition that I'm doing this to be a better doctor. I'm not doing this to be a nice guy, which is where often people say, well, why are we wasting time on this? You're not wasting time. You're building a necessary relationship in order to do better medicine. And it's the same as the airline's pilot. This guy who landed the plane in the Hudson tells us very interesting story that he learned that what he had to do with his new crew, which should be the co-pilot engineer, the flight attendants, is how he structures what they're there for. He says, what we're here for, first things out of his mouth, is to get ourselves and all these passengers back to their families. That's our job. Flying the plane is incidental. The job is to get back safely. And he thinks that makes a difference. To get a mindset. Our job is to get this patient well and back to his family or her family, not to fix the broken bone. It's a mindset toward the whole human being. ([Time 0:21:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/60cc4727-5b46-4577-b15f-769a66cc9e98))
