## Highlights
- Olympic Athletes
  Summary:
  Your maximum voluntary am ventilation is actually reduced. You're not able to produce a large enough every one. Olympic athletes probably run at a 80 meals peculia per minute. I'm pro forty mills, peculiar. Wates people, you're 55. Soness, but i it makes me say that i' probly nevery get better than that. Uthaa, so, so, vio two max. Have vyo ever masr o f two max? My garment tells me it's something like 55. Oh, that's amazing. So the way to think about it is, am i guessok. Let's talk about anarobic threshold, or your i

  apologize. It's not not your circulation, as in went when i say wen y fer wit rech, hundred percent, it's not because your circulation. It's because of am. You've got something wrong with your, with the ventilation side of things. In other words, that your that your maximum voluntary am ventilation is actually reduced. So it could be an issue of, you know, you're, you're not able to produce a large enough every one. And so you've got a smalle f on and so your your a maximum breeding capacity, o yor maxim or voluntary ventilation, is actually reduced. So the way to think about it is, am i guessok. Let's talk about anarobic threshold, or your i to max. Like, what's your, well, what what's vo to max? Have vyo ever masr o f two max. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  O oly. My garment tells me it's
  Speaker 1
  something like 55. Oh, that's amazing. O athletes, so, like, olympic athletes probably run at a 80 meals peculia per minute. I'm, i'm, i'm half dead. I'm pro forty mills, peculiar. Wates people, you're 55. Wate. Soness, but i it makes me say that i' probly nevery get better than that. Uthaa, so, so, vio two max. Like, what, weny, whenin go vi to max, what? What's your, what? What? What, like, how do you think? Abot, what's your definition of yo two?
  Speaker 2
  I say, is the maximum mills, pmills,

  milts, he mi of oxygen that you can actually consume, yes? Or that you can actually maintain an is pase on your cardy rascual respiratory ([Time 0:13:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7288a4ad-9ee8-4625-9ef0-091fef9cc381))
- The View Two Max Is Very Different From Anerobic Threshold
  Summary:
  view two max is very different from anerobic threshold. For example, i can reach high votos with running, but not cycling. My muscles are fatigued before i get to that point. So for mere mortals like me, my anarobic threshold is probably about a, a 50 % on my view of two max.

  Speaker 2
  I say, is the maximum mills, pmills,
  Speaker 1
  milts, he mi of oxygen that you can actually consume, yes? Or that you can actually maintain an is pase on your cardy rascual respiratory system. In other words, it's based on a, your biryf, your lungs to get oxygen, and a bit of your heart to liver that oxygen, and partly the
  Speaker 2
  muscles that you are using. For example, i can reach high votos with running, but not cycling. Ri s. My muscles are fatigued before i get to that point. Ye, interesteye, which is interesting. So, ye, ways, always thinking abouthat with c p x testin is on a cycle, on treadmill side. I don't thing i ever get up to the with that. Vito mae, running, beauty.
  Speaker 1
  Now, the other thing that youare so need to know is that, dam the view two max is very different from anerobic threshold. Yes. So your anerobic threshold is always going to be less than your view two max, because your anerobic threshold is the point at which oxygen demand of the muscles exceeds theability of your ca, cardio pomeary system to actually deliver it. K, so you can reach a high view too max, but you're not, you may not be able to sustain it, because youisyou u atually will have gone past you anarobic threshold. All right. So for mere mortals like me, my anarobic threshold is probably about a, a 50 % on my view of two max. All right. ([Time 0:14:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/093faa54-4a36-4356-aec3-97c1ce5cf288))
- Do You Have a Low Breething Reserve?
  Summary:
  If you have a low breething reserve, which is considered to be normal, it means now that what's limiting t you is your cardy rascal impairment. And i think it's been shown that the sh have high morbidity and mortality. A, youknow, for a lot of major operations, s ri win. All right. So, yos, you're actually reaching up to above hundred psecors. Rim that i said, our breathing, our breathing reserve is always, it should always be about 23%. If you'r aif you able get that tabot youno, 92, hundred %, it means thet's actually something wrong with your

  Speaker 1
  So, yos, you're actually reaching up to above hundred psecors. Rim that i said, our breathing, our breathing reserve is always, it should always be about 23 %. If you'r aif you able get that tabot youno, 92, hundred %, it means thet's actually something wrong with your ventilation. Because it's not your ventilation that's limiting you. It's actually your cardo promp. It's actually your cady vascular systemk, so what you sort of see is that if you're able to reach a breething reserve of cost a, hundred % a, it means that there's something wrong with your ventilation. Andad, that's how they sort of think about, think about am these things when they do your am carty promely testing. All right. Now, if you have a low breething reserve, which is considered to be normal, it means now that what's limiting t you is your cardy rascal impairment. All right. And so that that's the way, you know, broadley te sort of think about these things. And it is a little more complex in terms of, youknow, you do get sort of a mixed lesions. But that's probably the simplest way to sorrowi think, about this. And you know, when we think about c p x testing, a, i know, the numbers that o we sorrow think about is that when we test patience and they've got a anobic threshold of less than 11 mills, a peculiar per minute, that's when we think theyre riht. And i think it's been shown that the sh have high morbidity and mortality. A, youknow, for a lot of major operations, s ri win. When you see that ([Time 0:17:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bb2d2c14-9792-4c93-aa79-ef5a26ec768d))
- Anarobic Threshold
  Summary:
  Four mets is adequate, but greater than ten is coring to the latest a c c ah. If it's above that number and go, gep, great, you can go for go for our surgery. Thre's a few numbers that we really care about. What is 11 for ric threshold? Yes, four mets isadequate,. but greater than 10 is coring  to the latest ac c ah, a peroperative, a cardy vascula valuation guide lines.

  number. Yoeither
  Speaker 2
  relieved if it's above that number and go, gep, great, you can go for go for our surgery. And if it's less, then you a bit more, bit more worried. Tat's right. Remember seeing ye one ofm one of my relatives, actually had 12 mets. I on onrstressed hersel. Really impressed with that. That's that's great. Thre's a few numbers that we really care about. What is 11 for ric threshold? Yes, four mets is adequate, but greater than ten is coring to the latest a c c ah, a peroperative, a cardy vascula valuation guide lines, that's shown to be great to a evidence, fantastic for proceeding with uno major surgery. That's really good. Now, now,
  Speaker 1
  just as a a interesting sort of point, and the way to serve, another way to sort of think about this in terms of anarobic threshold, is that when we, when we think about a in, 11 peculo per minute. So in in a 70 kilogram person, all right, that would represent a oxygen delivery of about 770 mills per minute. Now, normal amoxy of consumption is aboutot two, 50 mules per minute rest, yes, res in assemli, so about three and a half mules bu kill per minute.

- Anerabic Threshold
  Summary:
  In in a 70 kilogram person, all right, that would represent a oxygen delivery of about 770 mills per minute. Normal amoxy of consumption is aboutot two, 50 mules per minute rest,. So what we're really asking an, you know, these patients do is approximately triple what they're am, what their base line is. We want them to have cardo pomeryn reserve where theyabe increase that that more than sort of three times, three times their base line.

  Now, now,
  Speaker 1
  just as a a interesting sort of point, and the way to serve, another way to sort of think about this in terms of anarobic threshold, is that when we, when we think about a in, 11 peculo per minute. So in in a 70 kilogram person, all right, that would represent a oxygen delivery of about 770 mills per minute. Now, normal amoxy of consumption is aboutot two, 50 mules per minute rest, yes, res in assemli, so about three and a half mules bu kill per minute. So what we're really asking an, you know, these patients do is approximately triple what they're am, what their base line is. So in other words, we want, we want am patience to be able to sort of manage stress by beable to, you know, have that cardo pomeryn reserve where theyabe increase that that more than sort of three times, three times their base line. Now, when we thought sort of thing about, you know, how normal physiology, so we only askin patients to do three times in terms of finou for surgeryor anaesthesia. We in ting want exercise
  Speaker 2
  actaly. So we want their vo to to be four mets, which is three point five times four. But then that's, that's kind o effort dependent. But we want that,
  Speaker 1
  all of all that to
  Speaker 2
  still be an, we want at least 11 mills per minute, picue per minute, o more that, ye, more, that to be anarobic. So, yes,
  Speaker 1
  well, yes, infact, that's where that four tot, that's where that four mats comes from, exactly. Yes. Cause
  Speaker 2
  you want it, you wanted above three. So isly, you know, as you want, yes, you want yo vety to be above four thats. But you want your anerabic threshold to be above the eleventh
  Speaker 1
  three times. ([Time 0:19:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7ee151f6-bd36-41ed-b76e-b2c21313cdc2))
- Ventilation and Oxygen Consumption
  Summary:
  Ventilation can increase, but 20 to 25 times. Yer, the figure about a hundred leters is in the range. And solookat the relations between minute ventilation and oxygen consumption. In heavy exercise, you know, your ventilation starts increasing expedientially. That's driven by lactic acedoses.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So, know, i think we talked about this in one of, in one of our earlier episodes, that with ventilation, you can esgo much, much more, yes. Am sumitd ventilation can increase, but 20 to 25 times. Ah,
  Speaker 2
  no, its cried masie, i remember that. Yer, the figure about a hundred leters is in the range. I think maybe you've got here, a hundred. N 70, is that right? Yes, yes. So and and so that would be, you know, if you think two leters orwat vital capacity, breadth, 60, 60 mills per keela, y, that byt, you know, whatever that respiratory is, to get 170. That's, that's quite incredible.
  Speaker 1
  Em o, it's massive, absolutely massive. And solookat the relations between minute ventilation and oxygen consumption. It's, it's approximately linear a. But what happens is that in heavy exercise, you know, you, you starts, your ventilation starts increasing expedientially, and that's driven by lactic acedoses. And at that point where it starts increasing, accidentally, you know, youyu, i think you've se t describe it as owl's point to o w sor some textboks will have aly what a os point is. And the reason for that is that when you get a anerobic metabolism, and you get the production of lectate, ([Time 0:22:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2e9f60a2-043d-4329-ac49-51a06b21c28e))
