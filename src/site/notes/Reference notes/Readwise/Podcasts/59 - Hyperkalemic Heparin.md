## Highlights
- The Incidence of Mild Hyperkalemia With Heparin Exposure
  Summary:
  The incidence of mild hyperkalemia with heparin exposure is about 7%. The main risk factor there was impaired renal function. There are actually clinical studies that had suggested this effect in aldosterone production, even back in the 1950s. One clue is that heparin fairly reliably reduces adrenal ald testosterone production.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So you know, there actually have been numerous subsequent case reports and series that have shown at this association, both with unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin. The exact incidence isn't really known, I don't think, but I saw a little review from 1995 in the American Journal of Medicine that estimated the incidence of mild hyperkalemia with heparin exposure is about 7%. And it seems like severe hyperkalemia to get that, it would really sort of require a second hit like another factor being present as well, like other medications that raise the potassium or renal dysfunction, something like that. But you know, we do see a similar picture with low molecular weight heparin exposure as well. There was a small prospective study from 2011 in the Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics that found that about 9% of patients treated with low molecular weight heparin did develop mild hyperkalemia. The main risk factor there was impaired renal function. So it seems to be a real thing.
  Speaker 2
  You know, nearing like 10% is, I don't know, I would say that's enormous because the number of patients that we take care of in the hospital who are on either sub-Q heparin or an oxaparin for prophylaxis, I mean, this is a lot of people. And I think there does seem to be a legitimate link between that drug and this effect, even if it only causes mild hyperkalemia. So I think we're interested to hear a little bit more about the mechanism here and like, because I wouldn't otherwise associate this drug with this side effect.
  Speaker 1
  One clue is that heparin actually fairly reliably reduces adrenal aldosterone production. This was first observed in rat in the 1960s around the same time of that first case report. And there are actually clinical studies that had suggested this effect in aldosterone production, even back in the 1950s.

- Can Increasing Aldosterone Levels Lead to Hyperkalemia?
  Summary:
  Aldosterone is a hormone that's secreted by the adrenal cortex. It activates the ENAC channel and the basal lateral sodium potassium ATPase pump in the distal naphron. Decreased aldosterone activity leads to a renal tubular acidosis known as a type 4 renal tubular Acidosis.

  One clue is that heparin actually fairly reliably reduces adrenal aldosterone production. This was first observed in rat in the 1960s around the same time of that first case report. And there are actually clinical studies that had suggested this effect in aldosterone production, even back in the 1950s. And so there was an experiment in the journal Endocrinology in 1964 that they found that incubating heparin with rat adrenal gland cells led to a decrease in aldosterone production. So the heparin with the adrenal cells, they sort of stopped making aldosterone and they saw a similar effect when they gave the heparin to live rats. So in both experiments, the decrease in aldosterone was actually selective, meaning that the rat's adrenal glands only decreased production of aldosterone after heparin exposure, but they continue to produce, say, cortisol at normal levels.
  Speaker 3
  So can we break down why decreasing aldosterone level production could lead to hyperkalemia?
  Speaker 1
  Yes, we can. And you know, that it takes, we have to go back to physiology a little bit and review that, you know, aldosterone is a hormone that's secreted by the adrenal cortex and it activates the ENAC channel and the basal lateral sodium potassium ATPase pump in the distal naphron. And both of these actions lead to excretion of potassium. So if you decrease aldosterone production from the adrenal glands, you would increase potassium levels. And aldosterone also stimulates proton secretion in the collecting ducts. So decreased aldosterone activity leads to a renal tubular acidosis known as a type 4 renal tubular acidosis.
  Speaker 2
  Okay, so that's sort of a nice reminder of why anything that suppresses aldosterone might lead to hyperkalemia. ([Time 0:06:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/858669d7-7ee7-4c24-9961-0d80add81003))
- Heparin Blocks Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Production
  Summary:
  The 1960s were the golden age of heparin hyper-kily-me aldosterone studies. Heparin directly blocks the effects of angiotensin 2 at the level of the zona glomerulosa cells in the adrenal gland, which was demonstrated in rats in 1986. So it will do it quickly. It will do it really quickly.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I feel like you've kind of demonstrated to us that the 1960s were the golden age of a heparin hyper-kily-me aldosterone studies. It was a very fertile time. Yeah. What a time to be alive. Okay. So I think you established that heparin can cause hyper-kily-me. It's certainly associated, and I think mechanistically, you're getting us there via the decreased production of aldosterone from the adrenal glands. But can you take us a little bit of a step further and talk about why heparin might do this?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. It's a really important question. And it requires us to do some more physiology review. Yes. So it will do it quickly. It will do it really quickly. We have to review the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, which mediates and controls aldosterone production. So aldosterone is made from the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland, and its production is stimulated primarily by a hormone called angiotensin 2. In addition to some stimulation by adrenocorticotropin hormone or ACTH, but it's mainly angiotensin 2. So you need angiotensin 2 around to stimulate the adrenal glands to make aldosterone. It turns out that heparin directly blocks the effects of angiotensin 2 at the level of the zona glomerulosa cells in the adrenal gland, which was demonstrated in rats in a study from the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry in 1986.

- The Off Target Effects of Heparin
  Summary:
  I was absolutely shocked when I learned this, but it actually makes sense based on the mechanisms we've been discussing. Heparin's ability to block Aldosterone production leads to retention of potassium as we've learned. And not surprisingly, it'll also lead to increased sodium excretion, our natural uresis. So more sodium in the urine means more production of urine and that means diuresis. It sounds like you're describing as a potassium spiron diuretic.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I think your phraseology there, the off target effects, I mean, that's what this is. And there was one more equally, perhaps even more for me surprising effect of heparin that I really doubt most people realize is going on when they prescribe heparin for a patient. I certainly didn't realize this is that heparin seems to have diuretic effects as well. What?
  Speaker 3
  Of course it does.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I was absolutely shocked when I learned this, but it actually makes sense based on the mechanisms we've been discussing. So if you recall how Aldosterone acts on the distal nephron, which we've focused on excretion of potassium, but it also causes retention of sodium, heparin's ability to block Aldosterone production leads to retention of potassium as we've learned. And not surprisingly, it'll also lead to increased sodium excretion, our natural uresis. So more sodium in the urine means more production of urine and that means diuresis.
  Speaker 2
  So heparin was spironolactone before spironolactone was spironolactone because it sounds like you're describing as a potassium spiron diuretic. ([Time 0:15:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fc38b710-d8bb-4ca9-8e98-824ee42750fa))
