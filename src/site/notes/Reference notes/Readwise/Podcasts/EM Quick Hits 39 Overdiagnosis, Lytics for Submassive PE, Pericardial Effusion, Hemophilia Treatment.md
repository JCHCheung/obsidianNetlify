## Highlights
- Hepatitis C - Factor Replacements in Adults With Hephelia
  Summary:
  Other infections include h i v and hepotitus b and c. This isn't really a problem to day with current factor replacements, but these are issues in adults with congenital hemophalia. Each unit of factor eight repletion per kilogram increases factor levels by two%. For major bleeds, aim for 100 % factor epletion. For minor bleed, shoot for 50% or less. When it comes to medications, avoid the intra muscular route. Use the oral i v or subcutaneous routes. The i m route can cause an intra muscular hematoma.

  Other infections include h i v and hepotitus b and c. This isn't really a problem to day with current factor replacements, but these are issues in adults with congenital hemophalia. The first recomnent factorins was in 19 87. Treatment before this included plasma derived factor f f p crio precipitate and blood transfusions. All of these increased the risk of transmitting h i v and hepotitus c. Before 19 85, we didn't ave a screen tool to detect h i v in donated blood and plasma. And for hepetiti c, we didn't have anything until 19 92. One final point for these patients in the e d. When it comes to medications, avoid the intra muscular route. Instead, use the oral i v or subcutaneous routes. The i m route can cause an intra muscular hematoma. In summary, bleeds are divided into major and minor bleeding episodes. For major bleeds, aim for 100 % factor epletion. For minor bleeds, shoot for 50 %. Each unit of factor eight repletion per kilogram increases factor levels by two %.
