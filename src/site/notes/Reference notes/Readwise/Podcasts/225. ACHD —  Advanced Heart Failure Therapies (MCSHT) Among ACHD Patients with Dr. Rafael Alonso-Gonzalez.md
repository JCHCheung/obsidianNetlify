## Highlights
- Congenital Heart Disease and Early Mortality Losses
  Summary:
  Patients with congenial heart disease who are transplanted have a worse early mortality. But if you stratify people, once you look at patients who have made it out to transplantation, they do better than those without the condition.

  And thanks for that, andy. But how do adult and genital heart disease patients do once they do end of getting advanced heart failure the such as heart transplantation? So do patients do worse give in their prior complex anatomy, as doctor alonzo brought up earlier? How do they do, especially compared to their counterparts without leno, such as the dilated cardomeopty patient that we alluded to earlier? Yes,
  Speaker 2
  and this is the real crux of the issue here. We have known and continue to see for decades now, the patients with congenial heart disease who are transplanted have a worse early mortality compared to their non congenial heart disease counterparts. So if you look at their survival curves up to a year, patients with congenal heart deseaverseeving a heart transplant, perform worse than those patients who have a non mcariomiopathy and some other forms of indications rather for transplantation.
