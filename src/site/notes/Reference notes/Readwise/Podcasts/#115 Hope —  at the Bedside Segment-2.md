## Highlights
- Helping Patients Navigate the Reality of Illness
  Key takeaways:
  (* Patients and their surrogates need to be open to new information and possibilities in order to achieve their goals., * There are many resources available to help patients and their surrogates cope with difficult truths.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Remember, you're not on your own. If patients or their surrogates are singularly focused on an unrealistic goal, we can partner with other services to understand and support their underlying emotional needs.
  Speaker 1
  People who are like, I can only hope for this kind of people. They didn't come out of nowhere. They have a history and a way of coping in the past that I need to understand. I need to be more curious about them. And sometimes I need to go to people who are smarter about psychological concepts than me, my social workers, my psychologists, my psychiatrists and say, hey, help me understand how to, what could I do to open more paths for them?
  Speaker 2
  Dr. Arnold mentioned some strategies for gently bringing patients into prognostic awareness in ways that help ease the emotional burden of looking at difficult truths.
  Speaker 1
  One of the things that a very smart doctor taught me is that I talk about their body separate from them. So your body seems to be sort of getting sicker. ([Time 0:17:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/730e5c60-dbed-4483-9cf1-e88262c3049f))
- Talking to a Dying Person: Reality Testing and the Body
  Key takeaways:
  (* One of the things that a very smart doctor taught the speaker is that they should talk to patients separate from their bodies. This helps to ease the conversation and allows patients to think more concretely about their future., * The speaker also worries about what might happen to the patient's body if it starts to get better. Regardless of modern medicine, if the patient is going to die, they are going to die.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  One of the things that a very smart doctor taught me is that I talk about their body separate from them. So your body seems to be sort of getting sicker. It's not them, it's not that they don't want to get better. Their body has made different choices than what they were hoping for.
  Speaker 2
  This can ease us into a conversation where we can think more concretely about the future.
  Speaker 1
  And I'll say, can we talk about what we might see from his body if it starts to get better and what we might see if it, that is, we begin to do a little hypothetical planning. And that's it for today. When we come back, we see how that sits with them. I don't push them. I offer, would you like to hear what my worry is? Because in the end, his body is going to do what his body does. And regardless of modern medicine, if he's going to die, he's going to die, right? We like to think we can keep bodies alive forever. But the truth is we can't.
  Speaker 2
  The body can continue to be a touchstone for reality testing throughout each encounter.
  Speaker 1
  What's your body telling you? I can do a functional assessment. Compared to three months ago, how's your appetite doing? How's your weight doing? How's your energy doing? Right? ([Time 0:18:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3ca3f06c-6233-4d9b-b893-541ddef932d3))
- The Importance of Hope in the ICU
  Key takeaways:
  (* Fighting against unrealistic hopes is not likely to be successful., * There has to be something beyond it to strive for in the conversation.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I think doctors, we don't like to be wrong. And so when people talk about things happening that we think is very unlikely, we feel the need to correct them. And part of what I'm saying is correcting people. You can try once, but if it doesn't work once, doing it over and over, it gets not sort of like not likely to work. And then I just want you to be more curious about it and try to expand rather than telling them that what they're hoping for is not likely to happen. Yeah.
  Speaker 3
  So simply fighting against unrealistic hopes is not likely to be successful. There has to be something beyond it to strive for in the conversation.
  Speaker 1
  When I see people in the ICU, everybody's like, the family doesn't get it. And the family says that doctors all say he's going to die, but we can't give up. We're hopeful. I'm like, heck yes, you're a loving son and daughter. The key question is, what is it to give up? The key question is, how can I hope for things that people don't think is going to happen? And yet, think about whether they may and help my loved one have as good of existence in the time that they're going to have. It's not, will they give up the hope that there's going to be an unexpected miracle? ([Time 0:21:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9e4f0d3d-6532-4e23-ac91-99ed97c98163))
- Hope in the Face of Illness
  Key takeaways:
  (* Hope is not a fragile commodity that is only anchored on certain outcomes., * Hope can be much more than just that.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  And one of the central themes about hope we want you to take away from this episode is that patient hopes are not this narrow, fragile commodity anchored only on certain outcomes. Hope is, or at least can be so much more than that.
  Speaker 1
  Because we're doctors, we think the only thing that people hope for is living as long as possible. I don't think we give them enough credit. And I can have one hope dashed and have other hopes fulfilled and I'm okay with that. You know, Tony Bakker is one of my colleagues, talks about what I want is a portfolio of hope, some of which are, I can clearly help them accomplish, some of which may be stretches, some of them may be like playing the lottery. The key is to have a portfolio of hope. That's what gets you up in the morning. It's not just hoping for one thing.
  Speaker 3
  It's when people start getting narrow that they may need help in expanding that hope portfolio, both through curious questioning like Dr. Arnold mentioned, but also through prompts or suggestions from off-source clinicians.

- How to Help Someone Hope
  Key takeaways:
  (* Hope is complex and contextual, with many conflicting realities held in the mind at the same time., * By focusing on one hope rather than another, it can help foster hope and trust in the listener.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I just ask, what else are they hoping for? Then say, can we focus on this one for today? That is, I can direct attention to one thing rather than another thing. That will often help us foster hope and foster trust that I care about their hopes and that I'm listening to them as people. I can just say, you hope not to have so much pain so you can go to the Fourth of July picnic, let's work on that, I think I can make a difference there. Remember, by putting your attention on some hopes rather than other hopes, you also give an implicit passage. That's okay, I can do it implicitly.
  Speaker 3
  The problem for many people is actually that we hold multiple conflicting hopes and realities in our head at the same time, with a lot of ambivalence between them. And this is totally normal. Dr. Arnold and his colleagues described hope using three C's that hope is complex, contextual, and continuous.
  Speaker 1
  For many people, I can know, acts, and still hope for why. We're a little bit like Alice in Wonderland. We can believe both A and non A. ([Time 0:26:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/95f651e5-53d1-4870-886b-5d6f9e33dc40))
- Resilience in Healthcare
  Key takeaways:
  (* Patients are resilient and can look into many possible futures when making healthcare decisions., * Patients should be able to hold onto hope even when facing difficult situations.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  If someone says, I know that you told me I'm going to live five months, I'm convinced I'm going to live five years. They're making a prediction about the future that neither of us know who's going to be right. The question is, as they hope to live for five years, can they also acknowledge and plan for five months? I'm more than okay with people hoping to live for five years, even if I think it's going to be less true. The example I'll tell is of a friend who had ovarian cancer, this was 10 years ago, she progressed through two cycles of ovarian cancer. She went on a microbiotic diet because that was going to cure the cancer. She therefore could explain her losing weight because of the microbiotic diet. Two days before she died, she wouldn't eat a crispy cream donut because she was still convinced the diet might kick in. On the other hand, she stopped doing chemotherapy. She agreed to hospice. She moved in with family. That is she never gave up her hope. The diet was going to work and she was going to be cured. She could hold both at the same time.
  Speaker 3
  We have to believe that patients are resilient enough to look into many possible futures when making healthcare decisions. We've all heard the saying, hope for the best, prepare for the worst. But one of the better ways I've heard it said is hope for the best, prepare for the rest. And this is a better way of saying it because, well, first, it rhymes and rhyming is always better. But also, there's so many possible futures to plan for it. It's not just about death. More importantly, doing this planning doesn't put their hope in jeopardy.
  Speaker 1
  One of my colleagues looked at advanced care planning and did it influence hopefulness. It didn't, by the way. People are worried that if you do advanced care planning, people give up hope. ([Time 0:29:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/743a87c3-d67a-4c7d-a86c-0074c3f69a56))
