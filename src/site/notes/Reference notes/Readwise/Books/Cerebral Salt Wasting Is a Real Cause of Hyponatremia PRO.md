## Highlights
- FEurate will not differentiate SIADH from CSW on first encounter with the patient because it is increased to >11% in both conditions when they are hyponatremic. Differentiation can only occur when FEurate normalizes to <11% in SIADH or is persistently increased at >11% after correction of hyponatremia by water restriction or isotonic or hypertonic saline ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h012mvyc4xfcbmzpfhtrfwy6))
