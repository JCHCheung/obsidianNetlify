## Highlights
- intubation (ATI) Awake tracheal is deﬁned as successful placement of a tracheal tube in a patient who is awake and breathing spontaneously. (Page 1)
- ATI is indicated in any patient with predictors of difﬁcult tracheal intubation or face mask ventilation; these may stem from pre-existing patient factors or as a consequence of the presenting pathology.5 In cases of recognised difﬁcult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, where facemask ventilation is possible, asleep techniques may be considered more appropriate, and it is useful to develop these skills for the management of the unpredicted difﬁcult airway. Absolute contraindications to ATI are limited only to the patient’s refusal, despite appropriate explanation. Relative contraindications include: allergy to local anaesthetic, airway bleeding (where blood may obscure the image achieved through a ﬂexible bronchoscope or videolaryngoscope), the uncooperative patient and certain airway tumours (with the potential to cause a ‘cork-in-bottle’ airway obstruction). (Page 2)
- Adequate airway topical anaesthesia is vital to the success of ATI approaches and lidocaine is commonly used for this purpose. It is available in a variety of pharmaceutical preparations, including combination with vasoconstrictors (such as adrenaline [epinephrine] and phenylephrine) which reduce the likelihood of epistaxis when nasal intubation is preferred.2 The maximum prescribed dose for topical anaesthesia is 9 mg (cid:3)1, although in practice doses this high should not be kg required by those experienced in ATI. Cocaine has the advantage of intrinsic vasoconstrictor activity but concerns regarding its adverse cardiovascular effects mean its use is no longer recommended. (Page 2)
- Antisialogogues reduce airway secretions, thereby improving airway anaesthesia and maximising the view achieved by a ﬂexible bronchoscope. Options include the antimuscarinic agents glycopyrrolate, atropine or hyoscine. If used, glyco(cid:3)1 i.m. should be given 4060 min before pyrrolate 4 mg kg performing ATI, for peak mucosal drying effect. The tachycardia associated with antimuscarinic agents may increase the patient’s anxiety and hinder ATI, and their use is therefore not considered mandatory. (Page 5)
- respiratory depression means it Dexmedetomidine is an agent with a-adrenoreceptor agonist activity with a markedly increased afﬁnity for a2 over a1adrenoreceptors in comparison with clonidine. Effects upon a2-adrenoreceptors within the pons mediate its sedative effects, whereas action at spinal a2-adrenoreceptors produces Its ability to produce sedation and analgesia analgesia. is becoming without increasingly used for procedural sedation including ATI, although this is currently an unlicensed use in the UK. The cardiovascular effects of a2-agonists are an important consideration. Inhibition of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) release and bradycardia reduce cardiac output and result in hypotension.18 Direct effects on vascular tissues after the injection of i.v. bolus doses may result in the development of transient hypertension, causing further reﬂex bradycardia.17 (cid:3)1 given over (cid:3)1 Doses are as follows: a loading dose 1 mg kg 1020 min followed by an infusion starting at 0.7 mg kg and titrated to the desired clinical effect at between 0.2 and 1.0 (cid:3)1.18 At the time of writing, no target controlled mg kg infusion (TCI) model exists. The long duration of bolus dose required is potentially problematic when ATI needs to be performed urgently. (cid:3)1 h (cid:3)1 h (Page 5)
- Remifentanil is a potent m-opioid receptor agonist. It is rapidly hydrolysed by non-speciﬁc tissue and plasma esterases responsible for its rapid offset in action and therefore ease in titration. It is an analgesic and antitussive agent that can be used as the single sedative agent during ATI. It may be used alone in the rare cases where topicalisation is contraindicated. Recent guidelines advocate its use at effect site (cid:3)1.2 It is associated with high concentrations of 1.03.0 ng ml rates of patients’ satisfaction, but the incidence of recall is higher when remifentanil is used as the sole agent.17 Adverse effects of remifentanil relevant to ATI include: bradycardia, hypotension, apnoea, hypoxia and chest wall rigidity. (Page 5)
- An unsuccessful attempt at ATI is deﬁned as unplanned removal of the ﬂexible bronchoscope, videolaryngoscope or tracheal tube from the airway.2 Repeated unsuccessful attempts at ATI increase the likelihood of airway bleeding, obstruction and further difﬁculty. (Page 6)
