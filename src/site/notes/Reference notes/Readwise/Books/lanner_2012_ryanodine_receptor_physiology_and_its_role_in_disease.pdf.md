## Highlights
- The ryanodine receptor (RyR) is the largest known ion channel; it is a homotetramer with a total mass of >2 MDa (each subunit is >550 kDa) (Page 2)
- RyR is localized in the plasma membrane of ER/SR and is a large conductance channel capable of creating rapid transient increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ (Page 2)
- creating rapid transient increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ [ 16, 17 ] . Four-ﬁ fths of the RyR protein is cytoplasmic and remaining, one-ﬁ fth, consists of luminal and membrane spanning domains. (Page 2)
- Three mammalian isoforms of RyR have been isolated and the terminology, RyR1-3, is based on in which order the isoforms were isolated and tissue of initial puriﬁ cation (Page 2)
- RyR1 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (Page 2)
- RyR2 is greatly expressed in cardiac muscle [ 12, 13 ] , and is considered to be the most abundant isoform in the brain (Page 2)
- RyR3 was ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed in the brain and is mainly found in cortical and hippocam-pal regions involved in learning and memory [ 15, 19, 21 ] . RyR3 is also expressed in the diaphragm (Page 2)
- RyR exist predominantly in the closed state, but it has been noted that they open randomly in the absence of any stimulus (Page 2)
- RyRs are modulated directly and indirectly by DHPR and by various ions, small molecules and proteins (Page 2)
- RyR1-3 have a similar sequence homology (~65%), but despite this the isoforms differ markedly in their response to modulators (Page 4)
- each subtype show different Ca 2+ binding afﬁ nities with RyR1 > RyR2 > RyR3 (Page 4)
- RyR1 activity shows a bell-shaped response curve; activated by low Ca 2+ concentrations (~1 m M) and inhibition by high Ca 2+ concentrations (~1 mM) (Page 4)
- The action potential in the t-tubules activates voltage sensitive dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), also known as L-type Ca 2+ channels (Ca v1.1 ), located in the t-tubular wall (Page 4)
- The low myoplasmic Ca 2+ is maintained mainly by the adenosine trispho-sphate (ATP) consuming SR Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA) (Page 4)
- Several mutations in both RyR1 and RyR2 are associated with human disorders. For example, the ﬁ rst of these to be identiﬁ ed in 1960 was malignant hyperthermia (MH) [ 37 ] and later central core disease (CCD), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and arrhyth-mogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) (Page 6)
- in the heart increased phosphorylation is associated with increased SR Ca 2+ leak, which contrib-utes to reduced contractile function and increased propensity for arrhythmias (Page 6)
- In skeletal muscle, increased SR Ca 2+ leak is linked to impaired muscle functions and exercise tolerance in mice (Page 6)
- RyR1 is considered to be the major molecular target for dantrolene (Page 8)
- adverse side-effects of dantrolene e.g. drowsiness, hepatoxicity, and signiﬁ cant muscle weakness preclude it from prophylactic usage (Page 8)
- Many patients with CCD also test positive for MH susceptibility in the characteristic in vitro caffeine contracture test (IVCT). (Page 8)
- CPVT was ﬁ rst described in the 1970s as a familial tachyarrhythmia disorder induced by exercise and emotional stress leading to sudden death in individuals with structurally normal hearts (Page 9)
- CPVT is a rare but severe form of cardiac arrhyth-mia caused by mutations in RyR2 and CSQ2 (Page 9)
- CSQ2 is a low-afﬁ nity, high-capacity Ca 2+ binding protein. CSQ2 is considered to be present in the SR as a mixture of monomers, dimers, and multimers. CSQ2 monomers interact with the RyR2 multicomplex via triadin and junctin (Page 9)
- As it is recognized that b -adrenergic stimulation triggers ventricular tachycardia in CPVT, b -blockers are the considered ﬁ rst-line therapy today, but unfortunately they are not completely effective in preventing life-threatening arrhythmias (Page 9)
- Recent reports show that ﬂ ecainide treatment completely prevents adrenergic-induced arrhythmias in a mouse model of CPVT and in humans with CSQ2 and RyR2 mutations (Page 10)
- Lidocaine is another Na + blocker that does not inhibit RyR2 and has very low clinical effect on CPVT (Page 10)
- ARVD is also a rare inherited disorder caused by RyR2 mutation located in same regions as CPVT and homologous with RyR1 mutations in MH and CCD (Page 10)
- ARVD is characterized by substitution of the right ventricular myocardium with ﬁ brofatty tissue, which appears to be a result of progressive death of cardiomyo-cytes resulting from apoptosis and inﬂ ammation (Page 10)
