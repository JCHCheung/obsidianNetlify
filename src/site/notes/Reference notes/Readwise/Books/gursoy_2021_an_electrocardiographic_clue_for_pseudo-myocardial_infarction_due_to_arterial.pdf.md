## Highlights
- leads I, II, and III are bipolar limb leads. (Page 2)
- or there will be no unaffected limb lead.1,2 Moreover, limb artifacts also affect precordial leads due to the Wilson central terminal, which constitutes the negative pole of the unipolar leads (Page 2)
- The augmented limb leads that use the Goldberger central terminal, an averaging ... of inputs from two of the three limb electrodes (Page 2)
