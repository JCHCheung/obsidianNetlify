## Highlights
- The questionsposed in this review—“What?”“So what?”“Now what?”—were taken from Strater et al.’s(2004) depiction ofthe three levels ofsituation awareness in Endsley’s (1987) definition. (Page 1)
- it was Endsley’s highly specificdefinition,created in the context ofaviation,that caught on and has been adapted acrossa variety ofdomains:the perception ofthe elements in the environment within a volume oftime andspace,the comprehension oftheir meaning,and the projection oftheir status in thenear future.(Endsley,1988,p.97)Endsley’s definition,with its clear,intuitive appeal and neat three-way classification,seemed to fit all domains. (Page 2)
- Information-processing psychologists see SA as separable from performance.Theylike to point out that good performance can accompany poor SA (as,for example,whenyou do not know why your computer is behaving strangely but,after trying a limitedset ofpossibilities such as rebooting,the problem is fixed) and,conversely,that bad per-formance can accompany good SA (for instance,when time pressure or other forms ofstress produce poor execution).Some see the acquisition ofSA as a multistage processin which disparate elements are integrated into a meaningful whole,or product.Theydistinguish the product ofSA (what can be reported at any given moment) from theprocess ofobtaining it,referred to as situation assessment(e.g.,active search ofthe envi-ronment or team communication patterns).Although it is possible to derive both kinds ofmeasures,information-processing psy-chologists have tended to favor product measures (e.g.,responses to midscenario probequestions).They like to speculate on where the contents ofSA reside—whether in short-term memory,working memory,or,most recently,long-term working memory.Theylike the notion oflong-term working memory because it explains why experts have suchremarkable SA (Page 3)
- Finally,information-processing psychologists distinguish SA from workload,whichhas to do with competing demands on limited cognitive resources.Situation assessmentis thought to require cognitive resources and therefore contributes to workload.Theynote that it is easier,therefore,to maintain SA when workload from other competingdemands is low and that,without extra effort,SA will suffer under high-workload con-ditions (Wickens,2002).Even under reasonable workload,however,they are concernedabout how easily events—even bizarre and highly striking events—can be missed whenthey are outside the immediate focus ofattention.They term this side effect offocusedattention inattentional blindnessor change blindnessand see it as a significant safetyissue for operators ofcomplex systems (Page 4)
- Ecological psychologists,on the other hand,are less enamored ofthe idea that SA andperformance can be out ofsynch.They emphasize the close relationship between percep-tion and action that occurs in the natural environment and the importance ofthe largerstructure,or context,surrounding a situation.To take an example,a doctor may have goodSA with respect to the patient’s diagnosis but show poor judgment in advising the patient.Rather than dismiss this case as an example ofpoor performance with good SA,an eco-logical psychologist would want to understand the SA that would be required in the largercontext that included patient behaviors and reactions.This context would certainly includethe doctor’s need to gain the patient’s acceptance for treatment options.Two points emerge from this way oflooking at situations.First,ecological psychol-ogists feel that situations have indeterminate boundaries—they can be conceived ofina narrow context (e.g.,the diagnosis) or in a larger context (the patient-doctor relation-ship),so there is not a single boundary.Second,in the ecological view,SA is tightlybound to actions.Once one becomes fully aware ofthe situation (how the patient is likelyto react under particular circumstances),the action implications are usually clear (forfostering compliance).What,then,would an ecological psychologist make ofthe compelling demonstrationsofinattentional blindness when,for example,participants who are instructed to focuson one oftwo superimposed films ofbasketball teams at practice fail to notice a womanwith a red umbrella as she walks across the court,let alone the presence ofa gorilla(Neisser & Becklen,1975;Simons & Chabris,1999)? To an ecological psychologist,theseexperiments are interesting but secondary.Ecological psychology argues that illusions(including illusions ofnormalcy in the inattentional blindness studies),though intrigu-ing,are not the basis on which to form a theory ofperception;they are the exceptionrather than the rule.Ecological psychology is more interested in the fact that participants,even when faced with a three-ring circus,are able to perceive the actions ofwhicheverevent they choose to follow.From this perspective,this demonstration says more about“how operators discover meaning within complex work domains”(Flach,1996,p.3) thanabout how they can be fooled. (Page 4)
- To summarize,the distinction between the two schools with respect to situationawareness can be expressed as follows:Information-processing psychologists emphasizethe limitations ofattention,whereas ecological psychologists ponder the opposite,action-oriented question—why we so rarely walk into walls or fall offcliffs. (Page 5)
- One attempt atsynthesis is the perceptual cycle,which emphasizes the importance ofcharacteristics ofsituations as well as the nature ofawareness. (Page 5)
- The perceptual cycle is a flowmodel in which knowledge,in the form ofschemas (called productsby some),influenceslooking and exploratory behavior;these perceptual processes,in turn,influence the con-tent ofthe schema.The updated schema redirects looking behavior recursively,yieldinga continuous cycle.With respect to the environment,the cycle recognizes the potentiallyunlimited amount ofinformation available either immediately or through further explo-ration.With respect to the operator,it recognizes that people have expectations that leadthem to perceive certain information more readily than other information.Neisser’s cycle has two important implications for SA.First,it supports the rapid,holistic perception ofexperts,such as the chess players observed by Chase and Simon(1973).Knowledge ofthe game leads to expectations,which,when the pieces are prop-erly placed,leads to rapid grasp of(and memory for) the entire board.Second,it intro-duces the possibility ofbias,when expectations lead one to overlook subtle differencesbetween situations.Thus,a situation in which the pilot experiences inadequate liftbecause he has forgotten to set the flaps on takeoffcan lead him to attribute the prob-lem to wind shear,especially ifit is raining and he has been warned to expect it.The cycledoes not stop there,however.Theoretically,at least,the pilot could seek further informa-tion to disambiguate the situation,either alone or with help from crew members. (Page 5)
- What distinguishes one situation from another? How can different kinds ofsitu-ations be classified? Some have proposed treating complex situations,often encounteredin work settings,as a set ofsimpler,concurrent situations,each reflecting a high-levelgoal and entailing a set ofprescribed tasks and procedures (Deutsch,Pew,Rogers,&Tenney,1994).According to this view,events that are either externally driven or pro-duced through operator actions occur within a situation.Furthermore,each concurrentsituation has associated with it a set ofpossible futures,depending on the operator’sactions.Unexpected happenings give rise to new goals with new concurrent situations.SA depends on differentiating a situation from possible similar situations as well as deter-mining its scope (e.g.,are we facing a series ofcoincidental failures or an act ofsabo-tage?).Situations can be characterized as routine,clear,and easily managed at one extremeand dangerous,confusing,and requiring extraordinary expertise at the other. (Page 6)
- Situations mayrequire awareness that there is a problem (noticing something needs attention),mak-ing discoveries (seeing a link between two symptoms),finding explanations (diagnosis),preventing accidents,and preparing for future actions (Page 6)
- Does a system that guides a pilot or a driver to a location throughvisual,verbal,or even tactile directional prompts enhance the operator’s SA or justimprove performance? (Page 7)
- What is a team? Team members have common goals and interdependent roles (Salas,Dickinson,Converse,& Tannenbaum,1992).“In a team,the success ofeach person isdependent on the success ofother team members”(Endsley,Bolte,& Jones,2003,p.194).Similarly,one can define a “team ofteams”in which the individual teams share goalsand play interdependent roles.Thus,team SA is “the degree to which every team mem-ber possesses the SA required for his or her responsibilities”(Endsley et al.,p.195).Itincludes awareness ofhow your work affects what others are doing,and vice versa.Given this formulation ofthe needs ofteam members,what can be done to foster teamSA? Endsley et al.(2003) proposed three solutions.The first is use ofshared displays andcommunication devices,as well as the benefits that accrue from being colocated.Beingable to observe where the other person is looking provides information about what theother person is attending to and what he or she may have missed.The second consistsofestablishing shared mental models,or a common understanding ofgoals,tasks,andprocedures.Team members acquire shared mental models by working together or engag-ing in cross training.The third consists ofincorporating practices that make for good team-work;these include contingency planning,making sure everyone understands and ispursuing a common goal,and fostering an atmosphere that encourages asking questions. (Page 7)
- Techniques for measuring SA have proliferated,generating great interest and discussion.The techniques fall into five categories:recall,anticipation (part-task),critical events,sub-jectiveratings,and physiological indicators. (Page 9)
- Concerns about SAGAT.The practical appeal and use ofSAGAT have raised someissues.For example,does SAGAT require operators to keep more in their head than theynormally would? Does SAGAT interfere with SA by providing an unnatural interrup-tion? Alternatively,does taking the test enhance SA by judiciously directing attention tovariables that might otherwise be overlooked? (Page 10)
- It made nodifference whether the attributes were associated with one object or multiple objects;ineach case,tracking multiple instances ofthe same attribute proved difficult. (Page 11)
- SAGAT-like tests could overestimate SAby directing attention to the important variables,especially ifthe queries were repeated. (Page 12)
- SAGAT-like tests may underestimate SA simply by interrupting processing ofthe event. (Page 12)
