## Highlights
- Managers do things right. Leaders do the right things – Peter Drucker (Page 9)
- “The culture of any society consists of the sum total of ideas, conditioned emotional responses, and patterns of habitual behavior which the members of that society have acquired through instruction or imitation and which they share to a greater or less degree” (Linton) • Culture is what happens when the boss isn’t looking – Unknown (Page 15)
- • Recipe of Culture = People + Behaviours + Leadership • Positive Culture? Positive people following positive people for positive reasons • Effective Culture? Safe, flourishing, empowering, achieves goals, contributes to society • Effective leadership? Can leaders do anything to change culture? (Page 16)
- • As a leader, we are psychologists • Understanding why your team follow you how to improve/sustain is key to team performance • Manage up effectively • “A leader without followers is just a guy taking a walk’ – West Wing (Page 26)
- Behaviours come from people • Appropriate behaviours are a manifestation of the selection of appropriate people • “Good begets good” so get good people and they will create/maintain good culture through good behaviours • Snowball effect of positive elements (Page 35)
- • Modelling good behaviours starts from the top so espouse the behaviours you want in your team/organisation • Lead with ‘love’ but don’t overspread it (loses value) and don’t be afraid to bring out the stick or ‘carrot-shaped stick’ • The most effective leaders are firm but fair (Page 36)
- • Talk the walk wherever you are – leaders are being watched constantly! • Aim for the minimum standard to be an acceptable one (Page 38)
- • • “Senior leaders empowering others is a myth, the truth is empowerment is a quality of the individual, not a gift bestowed on others by those with hierarchical power. Senior leaders in the hierarchy should use their authority to support those seeking to exercise their freedom and deploy power to make good things happen. This is not the same as empowering others” – Alison Reynolds et al • Staff engagement is also not an event, it’s a journey (Clark & Nath) Innovation/creation occurs when people are in a different mindset – you can’t force it (can’t ask someone be a genius), instead create the space/environment… (Page 43)
- Maslach et al’s six areas of work life that influence staff engagement and motivation • Workload, e.g. time demands, tasks that do or do not match skill level • Control, e.g. influence over the resources required to do a job • Reward, e.g. financial, social or intrinsic rewards • Community, e.g. sense of emotional connection to the group, shared sense of values • Fairness, e.g. perception of mutual respect • Values, e.g. ethical tasks, match of personal values to those of the organisation (Page 44)
- The light bulb did not come from the continuous improvement of candles. - Oren Harari (Page 45)
