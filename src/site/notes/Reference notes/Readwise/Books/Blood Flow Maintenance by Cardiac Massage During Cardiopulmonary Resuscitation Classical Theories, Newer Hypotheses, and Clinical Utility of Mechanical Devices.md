## Highlights
- the timing from cardiovascular collapse to CPR was a major determinant of the pump mechanism observed. Shorter times were associated with the cardiac pump mechanism and longer times with the thoracic or left atrial pump mechanism. This was interpreted as the effect of the delay in starting CPR, which might change the compliance of the lungs and the heart and then alter the mechanism of compression.[6](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/30155715#bibr6-1751143718778486) This suggests that, during the late stages of resuscitation, a thoracic pump mechanism might be the major determinant of forward blood flow because of a relatively stiff myocardium.

- The cardiac pump theory is likely to be the main mechanism during the initial phases of CPR. The contribution of the thoracic pump mechanism probably increases during resuscitation, becoming relevant in prolonged CPR ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5mwga1cr8hrhq1ab34sm2j7))
- three different classes of mechanical devices have been proposed: mechanical piston, load-distributing band, and active compressionâ€“decompression (ACD) devices. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5mwhn8356accq72ekg73fnw))
