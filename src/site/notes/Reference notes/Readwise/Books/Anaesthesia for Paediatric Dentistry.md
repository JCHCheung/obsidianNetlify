## Highlights
- When complete, the primary (deciduous) dentition consists of 20 teeth (Page 1)
- there are 32 perteeth (succedaneous) manent (Page 1)
- Before the age of 2 yr, a child is generally unable to distinguish between pressure and pain. Because of this, all forms of dental treatment will usually require general anaesthesia for these younger children (Page 1)
- Between the ages of 2 and 10 yr, a child may be able to understand the sensation of pain and differentiate it from other sensations such as pressure or vibration. Nevertheless, many dental procedures will still require general anaesthesia in this age group. (Page 1)
- The presence of facial swelling, due to either dentofacial infection or trauma, is of particular signiﬁcance as this may limit mouth-opening. (Page 2)
- Unless speciﬁcally advised by a cardiologist, antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is no longer indicated for children with cardiac lesions who undergo dental procedures. (Page 3)
- Anti-emetic agents, such as ondansetron, dexamethasone, or both, may be indicated for certain patients and should always be considered whenever administered. Dexamethasone has additional anti-inﬂammatory effects and has been demonstrated to reduce the swelling associated with some dental surgical procedures. analgesics opioid are (Page 4)
- During the course of many dental procedures, the surgeon will inﬁltrate a solution of local anaesthetic agent combined with a vasoconstrictor. This has the primary function of improving haemostasis, and may also contribute to postoperative analgesia. (Page 4)
- Minor complications of general anaesthesia for paediatric dentistry include postoperative headache, nausea, retching, and vomiting, particularly in the presence of swallowed blood. Damage may occur to the operative site. teeth adjacent tissues or to soft (Page 4)
- Although halothane is now rarely used to provide general anaesthesia for paediatric dentistry, cardiac arrhythmias may still occur intraoperatively and may result in cardiac arrest. Contributing factors are thought to include high levels of endogenous catecholamines, stimulation of the trigeminal nerve, and the use of epinephrine-containing local anaesthetic agents. (Page 5)
