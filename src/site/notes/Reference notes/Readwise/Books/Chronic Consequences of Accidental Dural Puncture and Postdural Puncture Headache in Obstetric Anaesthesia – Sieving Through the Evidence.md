- ADP may be associated with a high rate of PDPH, prolonged hospitalization, increased numbers of readmissions and chronic headache [[23,24\|23,24]](#R23). Less frequent complications may include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [[25,26\|25,26]](#R25), bacterial meningitis, pneumocephalus and subdural haematoma ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzywh4z5dmf71kacmrpv87kw))
- it has been postulated that CSF leakage after dural puncture results in ‘sagging’ of intracranial structures, intracranial hypotension and cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, which may cause the postural headache seen in PDPH. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzywj401y09rxxcwh069zvy0))
- Headache is presumed to result from loss of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the dural puncture, leading to a downwards gravitational shift of intracranial contents and traction on pain-sensitive intracranial structures, which worsens when the patient is upright and is relieved on lying down ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzywne5h0jeb81vw5ddq8d40))
- The second mechanism is thought to be compensatory vasodilatation to retain balance within the intracranial space in accordance with the Monro-Kellie doctrine, or reflex vasodilation resulting from traction on intracranial vessels in response to the low intracranial pressure which again causes headache ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzywr3qcvv64328qab69khrq))
- major, severe, life-threatening neurologic complications may follow PDPH in obstetric patients including subdural hematoma and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzyxahnmkqq22x85mg5mcw6n))
