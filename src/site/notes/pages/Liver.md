# Liver

## Anatomy
### lobes
- classical anatomy
	- divided by ==falciform ligament==
- Sir James Cantlie (1897)
	- divided by ==middle hepatic vein==
		- line between gallbladder fossa to external border of [[IVC\|IVC]]
- Claude ==Couinaud== (1950s)
	- 8 functional segments
		- based on 'segmental pedicle'
			- = blood vessels & bile ducts
- ==Takasaki== classification
	- 4 functional segments
### ligaments
- falciform ligament
	- separates Rt & Lt **anatomical** lobes
- coronary ligaments
	- attach liver to diaphragm
## Vascular supply
- dual supply
	- hepatic artery
	- portal vein
- total hepatic supply ~1500ml/min
	- 300ml from HA
	- 1200ml from PV
	- each delivering 50% of O2 to liver
### Portal vein
- PV pressure typically 5-10mmHg
	- higher than IVC
- portal hypertension
	- PV pressure >10mmHg
	- PV-IVC gradient >4mmHg
### Hepatic vein
- drains into RA
	- ∴ extremely sensitive to venous outflow obstruction / ↑RAP
- prolonged obstruction of outflow → ↑intrahepatic blood volume → hepatic dysfunction
### blood reservoir
during acute haemorrhage: ==ortho-sympathetic mediated vasoconstriction== → ↑circulating blood volume by ~25% of blood loss

## Zones
### Zone 1
- periportal
- surrounding portal space
- most ==oxygenated==
	- ∴ most resistant to haemodynamic insults
- responsible for intense metabolic & synthetic activity
	- e.g. ==glycogenolysis & gluconeogenesis==
- ==↑ regenerative capacity==

### Zone 3
- pericentral
- contiguous w/ central vein
- hypo-oxygenated
	- ∴ susceptible to haemodynamic insults & hypoxia
- ↓ regenerative capacity
- site for ==ketogenesis==
- ==Phase 1 & 2 metabolism==
	- ==glycuronoconjugation & detoxification==
