# Aspiration pneumonitis - Paed
- in children incidence 0.6 - 12 in 10,000
- majority of aspiration incidents NOT lead to patient harm
	- aspiration of **solid materials** → asphyxia / death
	- aspiration of **clear fluid**, regardless of __acidity__, will NOT
- real threat in children is **hypoxia** rather than **aspiration**
- Risk factors
	- emergency surgery
	- high [[ASA\|ASA]] status
	- gastrointestinal comorbid conditions
	- laryngospasm
	- NPO violation
	- [Difficult airway](../Medicine/Difficult%20airway.md)
	- gastroesophageal reflux
	- obesity
	- ↑ [[IAP\|IAP]]

# Gastric fluid content
- 'critical gastric volume'
	- 0.4 → 0.8 → 1.25 → 1.5ml/kg
		- laboratory study → NGT suctioning → [[gastric ultrasound\|gastric ultrasound]]

Aspiration also depends on other things
- lower oesophageal sphincter pressure
- anaesthesia level
	- to avoid coughing / straining
