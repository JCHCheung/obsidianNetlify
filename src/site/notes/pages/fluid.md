# Crystalloids
## normal saline
- first reported by Hamburger
- Consequent of ↑Cl content:
	- renal vasoconstriction
	- ↓renal blood flow
	- ↓[[GFR\|GFR]], diuresis
	- ↓[[RAAS\|RAAS]]
- suitable for [[pyloric stenosis\|pyloric stenosis]]

Balanced solution: isotonic, isoionic, isohydric
## Ringer's solution
- first described in 19th century by Sydney Ringer
- modified by Alexis Hartmann et al from St louis
	- adding sodium lactate to prevent metabolic acidosis

compared to [Lactate](Lactate), [[acetate\|acetate]] metabolism is significantly faster & more independent of hepatic function, w/ a lower ↑ in O2 consumption & no interference w/ diagnostic use of [Lactate](Lactate) as marker of inadequate tissue perfusion

# Colloids
- interfere w/ coagulation
	- measurable changes of [[TEG\|TEG]] parameters from dosage of 10-15ml/kg
- impair renal function

## HES
- causing renal impairment
## gelatin
- ?higher allergenic potential

## albumin
- comprises >50% of plasma proteins
- responsible for 80% of intravascular oncotic pressure
- main regulator of vascular barrier
- antioxidant in plasma
- transporter of [nitric oxide](nitric%20oxide), fatty acids, drugs
- anticoagulant & antithrombotic functions
- extracted from human blood
	- virus safe
- most expensive colloid besides plasma
