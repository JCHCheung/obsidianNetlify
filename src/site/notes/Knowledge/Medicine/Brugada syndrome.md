# Brugada syndrome
1.  ECG interpretation of Brugada pattern: type 1 (coved) is ==pathognomonic==, but type 2 (saddle-back) requires checking lead placement (negative P in V1 or biphasic P in V2 are too high) and measuring the base of the triangle (>4mm measured 5mm from the apex of râ€™)
2.  Treat reversible causes of ==Brugada phenocopy== (eg hyperkalemia, RV/anterior ischemia)
3.  Diagnosis, management and risk stratification of Brugada syndrome: treat fever and stop inciting meds/drugs; type 1 patients who are symptomatic (arrest, nonvagal syncope, seizure, agonal breathing) require ICD, and asymptomatic patients can be referred for provocative testing
