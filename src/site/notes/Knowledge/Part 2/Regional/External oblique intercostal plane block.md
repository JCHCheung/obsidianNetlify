# External oblique intercostal plane block

2019 by Elsharkawy et al.

## Anatomy
- Anterolateral upper abd wall innervation : ventral rami of ==T6 - T10==
	- Two key branches of intercostal nerves
		- Lateral cutaneous
		- Anterior cutaneous
- External oblique
	- Thin broad muscle
	- Spanning both thorax & abd
	- Originates on external surfaces of ribs 5-12
	- Form digitations w/ serratus anterior & latissimus dorsi
	- Courses anteriorly from midclavicular line à form aponeurosis à becomes part of ant rectus sheath
- Spinal nerves T6 - T9
	- Emerge from costal margin into plane btw IO & TA
	- Then enter lateral border of rectus sheath à terminate as anterior cutaneous branches
## Benefits
- Superficial
	- Ease to perform
	- Safe in anticoagulated pt
	- Less affected by body habitus
		- <4cm deep
- Not interfere w/ surgical incision
- USG image not disrupted by surgical incision
- Performed supine
## Landmark
- Anterior axillary line
- Level of xiphoid process
	- → 6th rib
- EO confirmed by:
	- Tracing to subcostal TAP view
	- Move probe laterally to visualise junction btw serratus anterior & EO
- possibility of landmark technique
## LA dose
- Bolus: 15 - 30ml
- Infusion 10 - 15ml programmed intermittent bolus Q2-3H
