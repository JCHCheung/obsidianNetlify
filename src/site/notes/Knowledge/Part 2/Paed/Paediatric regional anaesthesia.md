# Paediatric regional anaesthesia
for many years it was presumed that neonates and infants had underdeveloped nervous systems, and thus did not feel pain or remember painful experiences. Landmark studies clearly refuted these longstanding fallacies

# [[Caudal anaesthesia\|Caudal anaesthesia]]
- introduced by Meredith Campbell's at ASRA in 1933

## ADAPREF study
- >24000 regional blocks
- Cx rare & mostly minor
- 0 adverse events among **peripheral** blocks

## benefits of RA
- More haemodynamically stable
	- even in neonates & premature infants
		- tolerate SA well
		- ∵ balanced autonomic changes
			- sympatholysis w/ withdrawal of cardiac vagal activity
		- haemodynamic changes from SA resemble adults at **>6yo**
- ↓ risk of early post-op apnoea cf GA
- ↓ post-op ventilatory support
	- ? ∵ opioid sparing
- ? avoiding airway manipulation
	- if no GA as backup
- [[ERAS\|ERAS]]
	- ↓LOS
	- cost saving
	- ↑gut mobility

## Controversies
### Compartment syndrome
The European Society of Regional Anaesthesia and Pain Therapy and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Joint Committee released a joint statement that supported the safe use of regional anesthesia in pediatric patients with no evidence that it may increase the risk of acute compartment syndrome or delay its diagnosis

| Local Anesthetic Concentration             | Single shot (Peripheral and neuraxial):  <br>Use 0.1%–0.25% bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, or ropivacaine concentrations                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                            | Continuous Infusions  <br>Use 0.1% of Bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, or ropivacaine concentration                                                                  |
| High Risk Surgery for Compartment Syndrome | These include tibial compartment surgery, advised to restrict both volume and concentration in sciatic catheters to avoid overly dense nerve blockade             |
| Local anesthetic additives                 | Use with caution as additives can increase duration and/or density of block                                                                                       |
| Monitoring                                 | Patients at higher risk for compartment syndrome who have received a regional anesthetic should be followed by an acute pain service to allow for early detection |
| Urgent Workup                              | If compartment syndrome is suspected, compartment pressure should be urgently measured                                                                            |
## test dose
The test dose should contain 0.1 ml/kg of local anesthetic with 5 μg/mL of epinephrine. The dose of epinephrine is considered sufficient to detect hemodynamic changes, yet small enough that it would not be detrimental to the patient

Several factors that have been hypothesized to alter the reliability of a test dose: a) general anesthesia, including premedication, during the time of the test dose administration; b) higher basal heart rate in pediatric patients; c) variation based on age and the cardiovascular response to epinephrine.

### LOR
Less than 1 mL of air is recommended for use in infants when utilizing air. A lower volume of saline will avoid dilution of the local anesthetic, which may impact block efficacy, and to allow for better identification of a dural puncture

### Caudal block & hypospadias
researchers hypothesized that the sympathetic block resulting from CEB can lead to penile sinus vasodilation, venous pooling causing penile engorgement and impaired wound healing

Given available data and literature, it is unlikely that the type of regional anesthesia is associated with postoperative complications following hypospadias repair. Age, severity of hypospadias, and surgical repair technique and surgeon experience are more likely contributing risk factors.


## block after GA vs awake

One of the biggest identifiable differences between adult and pediatric regional anesthesia is the propensity to perform blocks, both peripheral and neuraxial, after the induction of general anesthesia in the pediatric population, as opposed to awake or with minimal sedation as in adults. Therefore, one of the primary challenges in recent times has been addressing safety concerns, particularly when performing regional techniques in conjunction with general anesthesia. This combination raises concerns about the loss of critical sensory feedback, which typically serves as an alert for unintentional intravascular injection or paresthesias, signaling potential nerve injury.

The risk for neurologic or severe local anesthetic toxicity was found to be higher for awake or sedated blocks than under general anesthesia, even when adjusted for age
