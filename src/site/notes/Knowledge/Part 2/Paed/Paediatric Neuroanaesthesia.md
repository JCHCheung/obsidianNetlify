# Background
Although it is known that cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases from age 7 months and peaks at 6 years, the lower limits of cerebral autoregulation in children and especially neonates are unclear

Cerebral autoregulation appears to be intact at birth in healthy patients

# Blood sparing techniques
- [[induced hypotension\|induced hypotension]]
- [[acute normovolaemic haemodilution\|acute normovolaemic haemodilution]]
- [[antifibrinolytics\|antifibrinolytics]]
	- [TXA](../../Medicine/tranexamic%20acid.md)
	- [[epsilon aminocaproic acid\|epsilon aminocaproic acid]]

# Regional techniques
- especially posterior cranial surgery as more painful
