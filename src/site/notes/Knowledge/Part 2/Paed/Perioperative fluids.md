# Background
4-2-1 formula of Holliday and Segar

# Hypotonic maintenance solution
- originally suggested based on calculation
	- periop use → [[hypoNa\|hypoNa]] → permanent brain damage / death
	- ∵ ↑ADH from stress & volume depletion
		- risk of hyponatremic encephalopathy high for prepubescent children
			- ∵ ↑ brain-size-to-cranial-vault ratio
			- ↓ Na-K ATPase activity
			- ↑ADH level in response to stress

# Dextrose
- traditionally 5% glucose added to paed maintenance infusion
	- → [[hyperglycaemia\|hyperglycaemia]] in periop context
		- ∵ surgical stress
			- ↑ counter insulin hormone levels
				- e.g. cortisol, glucagon, epinephrine, GH
			- ↓ [[insulin\|insulin]]
		- → hyperglycaemia induced catabolic state
- Population high risk of [[hypoglycaemia\|hypoglycaemia]]
	- infants
	- liver disease
	- malnourishment
	- [[burns\|burns]]
	- prolonged fasting
- glucose concentration of **1 - 2.5%** adequate to prevent lipolysis & [hypoglycaemia](hypoglycaemia) w/o risk of [hyperglycaemia](hyperglycaemia)

|Risk factors for perioperative hypoglycaemia|   |
|---|---|
|Patient-related risk factors|Age <12 months|
||Weight for age <5th percentile|
||Failure to thrive|
||ASA status ≥ III|
||Metabolic disease|
||Developmental delay|
||Gastric or jejunal feeding tube|
||Low glycogen reserve (parenteral nutrition, liver disease, beta blockers, diabetic mother)|
|External risk factors|Malnutrition|
||Long fasting times|
||Abdominal surgery|

# Maintenance infusion rate
- starting w/ **10ml/kg/h**
	- account for deficits from fasting
	- assure stable homeostasis
- after 1-2h → adjust to actual requirements
	- e.g. 4-2-1 formula

moderate certainty evidence from Cochrane that in children >6mo maintenance rate of 30ml/kg/h ↓ [PONV](../../Medicine/Postoperative%20nausea%20and%20vomiting.md) in ASA 1 to 2 for ambulatory or short LOS procedures

# Fluid type
- isosmotic / **isotonic**
	- effective osmolality similar to plasma (**288**mOsm/kgH2O)
- isoionic
	- fluid contain physiological values of important plasma electrolytes
- isohydric = balanced
	- potential [[BE\|BE]] of 0±10mmol/l

extracellular space larger in small children relative to BW, proportion of blood volume in the ECF is lower than in older children & adults (newborns 10%, infants 20%, adults 25%)

## neonates
- limited physiological range for urine osm
	- preterm: 50 - 600mOsm/L
	- term infants: 50 - 800mOsm/L
	- (adults 40-1200mOsm/L)
	- → limited capacity to excrete / conserve Na
- ↑rate of glucose utilisation ∵ metabolic demands of developing brain
	- 4-8mg/kg/min glucose
	- 10ml/kg/h of glucose 1%, 2% & 4% in LR equivalent in newborns
		- 2-4% dextrose fluids more effective at preventing untoward events
